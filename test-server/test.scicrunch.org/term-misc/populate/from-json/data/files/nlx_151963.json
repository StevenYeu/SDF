{"Higher order thalamic relay nucleus":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Thalamic relay nucleus","Id":"nlx_151963","DefinitionPMID":"12626004","Definition":"A thalamic relay nucleus that relays information from layer 5 of one cortical area to another, as distinguished from a first order relay nucleus that transmits subcortical information to the cortex, as proposed by Sherman and Guillery. All thalamic relays receive a layer-6 modulatory input from cortex, but higher-order relays in addition receive a layer-5 driver input, e.g., pulvinar nucleus."}}
