(PubChem) Pharmacology: Echothiophate Iodide is a potent, long-acting cholinesterase inhibitor used as a miotic in the treatment of glaucoma. Echothiophate iodide will depress both plasma and erythrocyte cholinesterase levels in most patients after a few weeks of eyedrop therapy. Mechanism of action: Echothiophate Iodide is a long-acting cholinesterase inhibitor for topical use which enhances the effect of endogenously liberated acetylcholine in iris, ciliary muscle, and other parasympathetically innervated structures of the eye. It thereby causes miosis, increase in facility of outflow of aqueous humor, fall in intraocular pressure, and potentiation of accommodation. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Cholinesterase Inhibitors. Miotics. Parasympathomimetics"}}
