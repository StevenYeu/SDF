Andersen et al. \"The Hippocampus Book\" 2007","Definition":"The CA3 Lacunosum Moleculare (LM) neurons are interneurons with somata in stratum lacunosum-moleculare that receive converging stimulation from the DG and entorhinal cortex as well as from within CA3. These LM neurons have dendrites that are oriented horizontally within the layer but occasionally have branches that extend into the pyramidal cell layer. The axon also takes a predominantly horizontal orientation and ramifies mainly in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare or superficial layer portion of the stratum radiatum."}}
