It is an inhibitor of thymidylate synthase. Pharmacology: Raltitrexed belongs to a group of medicines known as antimetabolites. It is used to treat cancer of the colon and rectum. It may also be used to treat other kinds of cancer, as determined by your doctor. Raltitrexed blocks an enzyme needed by the cell to live. This interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by raltitrexed, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, like hair loss, may not be serious but may cause concern. Mechanism of action: Raltitrexed is an antineoplastic Agents and folic acid antagonists. Raltitrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS) leading to DNA fragmentation and cell death. It is transported into cells via a reduced folate carrier. Inside the cell Raltitrexed is extensively polyglutamated, which enhances thymidylate synthase inhibitory power and duration, resulting into increase of antitumor activity. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antimetabolites. Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic. Antineoplastic Agents. Enzyme Inhibitors. Folic Acid Antagonists"}}
