{"Striatum of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["striatum p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151539","Is part of":"Subpallium of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"The striatum is most easily segmented on coronal diffusion-weighted images (DWI). The entire dorsal and lateral border is defined by the corpus callosum\/external capsule\/deep cerebral white matter complex, which is much darker (higher diffusivity) on DWI. Rostrally, the striatum emerges from the center of darker forceps minor of the corpus callosum as a light, speckled patch. The ventral border between the caudate\/putamen and the accumbens can be identified based on the end of the dark striations that define the caudate\/putamen. Further caudal, the ventral border between the amygdala and striatum is similarly easy to identify based on the end of the dark striations. The medial border with the pallidum is subtle and may be indistinguishable on T2 MRI. On DWI, the pallidum is somewhat darker than the caudate\/putamen and is more densely striated. By narrowing the contrast window, this difference can be accentuated enough to make the border apparent. At its caudal extent, the striatum is a small triangular region bounded laterally by the darker external capsule, medially by the darker internal capsule and fimbria, and ventrally by the much brighter and non-striated amygdala."}}
