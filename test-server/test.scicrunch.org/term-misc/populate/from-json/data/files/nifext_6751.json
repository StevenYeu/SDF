This subtype of dopaminergic receptor decreases adenylyl cyclase activity through inhibitory G-proteins. This receptor is expressed in phylogenetically older regions of the brain, especially enriched in the Islands of Calleja, olfactory tubercles, and the nucleus accumbens. This suggests that this receptor plays a role in cognitive and emotional functions. It is a target for drugs which treat schizophrenia, drug addiction, and Parkinson's disease. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants that would encode different isoforms, although some variants may be subject to nonsense-mediated decay.
