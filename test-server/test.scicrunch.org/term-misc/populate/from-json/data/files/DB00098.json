Thymoglobulin is a polyclonal antibody that suppresses certain types of immune cells responsible for acute organ rejection in transplant patients. Thymoglobulin is a mixture of antibodies intended to bind to various cell surface antigens. The most common mode of action of Thymoglobulin is via selective depletion of T-cells. Pharmacology: This immunosuppressive product, obtained by immunization of rabbits with human thymocytes, contains cytotoxic antibodies directed against antigens expressed on human T-lymphocytes. This reduces the host immune response against tissue transplants or organ allografts. Mechanism of action: Binds to multiple, T-cell specific antigens leading to T-lymphocyte cell death via complement mediated cytotoxicity or apoptosis. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Immunomodulatory Agents"}}
