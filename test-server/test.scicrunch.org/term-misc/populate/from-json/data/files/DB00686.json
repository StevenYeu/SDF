(PubChem) Pharmacology: Pentosan polysulfate sodium is a low molecular weight heparin-like compound. It has anticoagulant and fibrinolytic effects. Mechanism of action: Pentosan polysulfate is a polymer of xylose hydrogen sulfate and contains two sulfate groups per carbohydrate monomer. It binds Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) as well as other heparin-binding growth factors. It has been shown to interact also with the heparin-binding site of FGFR-1. It inhibits the growth of SW13 adrenocortical cells transfected with FGF-4 and tumorigenicity of MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells transfected with FGF-1 or FGF-4. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal. Anticoagulants. Enzyme Inhibitors"}}
