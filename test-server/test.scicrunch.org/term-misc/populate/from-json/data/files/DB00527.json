It is one of the most potent and toxic of the long-acting local anesthetics and its parenteral use is restricted to spinal anesthesia. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1006) Pharmacology: Dibucaine is an amide-type local anesthetic, similar to lidocaine. Mechanism of action: Local anesthetics block both the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses by decreasing the neuronal membrane's permeability to sodium ions. This reversibly stabilizes the membrane and inhibits depolarization, resulting in the failure of a propagated action potential and subsequent conduction blockade. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anesthetics, Local"}}
