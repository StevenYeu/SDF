It is closely related to piroxicam. In Europe it is marketed under the brand names Movalis, Melox, and Recoxa. In North America it is generally marketed under the brand name Mobic. In Latin America, the drug is marketed as Tenaron. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Meloxicam is an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic and antipyretic properties. Prostaglandins are substances that contribute to inflammation of joints. Meloxicam inhibits prostaglandin synthetase (cylooxygenase 1 and 2) and leads to a decrease of the synthesis of prostaglandins, therefore, inflammation is reduced. Mechanism of action: Anti-inflammatory effects of meloxicam are believed to be due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthetase (cylooxygenase), leading to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. As prostaglandins sensitize pain receptors, inhibition of their synthesis may be associated with the analgesic and antipyretic effects of meloxicam. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule.
