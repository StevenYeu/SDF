Natalizumab contains human framework regions and the complementarity-determining regions of a murine antibody that binds to a4-integrin. Natalizumab was voluntarily withdrawn from U.S. market because of risk of Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). It was returned to market July, 2006. Pharmacology: In multiple sclerosis, lesions are believed to occur when activated inflammatory cells, including T-lymphocytes, cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Leukocyte migration across the BBB involves interaction between adhesion molecules on inflammatory cells, and their counter-receptors present on endothelial cells of the vessel wall. The clinical effect of natalizumab in multiple sclerosis may be a secondary result of its blockade of the molecular interaction of a 4b 1-integrin expressed by inflammatory cells with VCAM-1 on vascular endothelial cells, and with CS-1 and\/or osteopontin expressed by parenchymal cells in the brain. Mechanism of action: Binds to the 4-subunit of 4b 1 and 4b 7 integrins expressed on the surface of all leukocytes except neutrophils, and inhibits the 4-mediated adhesion of leukocytes to their counter-receptor(s). Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Immunomodulatory Agents"}}
