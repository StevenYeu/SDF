It is an alpha2-adrenergic agonist. Pharmacology: Apraclonidine significantly lowers intraocular pressure with minimal effects on cardiovascular and pulmonary parameters. It lowers intraocular pressure by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Mechanism of action: Apraclonidine is an alpha adrenergic receptor agonist. It has a peak ocular hypotensive effect occurring at two hours post-dosing. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that Apraclonidine has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Adrenergic alpha-Agonists. Antiglaucomic Agents. EENT Drugs. Ophthalmics"}}
