The drug is well tolerated and has no anticholinergic side effects. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Astemizole, an H1-receptor antagonist, is similar in structure to terfenadine and haloperidol, a butyrophenone antipsychotic. It has anticholinergic (atropine-like) and antipruritic effects. Mechanism of action: Astemizole competes with histamine for binding at H1-receptor sites in the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial muscle. This reversible binding of astemizole to H1-receptors suppresses the formation of edema, flare, and pruritus resulting from histaminic activity. As the drug does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier and preferentially binds at H1 receptors in the peripehery rather than within the brain, CNS depression is minimal. Astemizole may also act on H3-receptors, producing adverse effects. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Withdrawn. Drug category: Anti-Allergic Agents. Antihistamines.
