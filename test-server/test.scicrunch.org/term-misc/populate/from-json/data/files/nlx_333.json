{"Barrel":{"DefiningCriteria":"cyto-architecture","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Regional part of brain","Id":"nlx_333","Is part of":"Barrel cortex","Species":"Rodent","DefiningCitation":["Woosley","T.A.","Van Der Loos"],"Definition":"A cytoarchitectural unit of the barrel cortex characterized in Nissl preparations a dense ring of cell bodies which has, roughly, the shape of a  circle or an ellipsoid.  As originally described by Woolsey and Van der Loos,  this ring represents the side of the barrel and surrounds an area of lower cell density which they named the hollow. Each barrel is separated from its  neighbors by a clear, nearly acellular area  termed  the septum. In tangentially  oriented sections, a septum can be seen to separate a barrel from its neighbors."}}
