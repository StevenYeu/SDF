It is composed of iodine combined with ethyl esters of fatty acids of poppyseed oil, primarily as ethyl monoiodostearate and ethyl diiodostearate. The precise structure is not known. Pharmacology: There has been little detailed investigation of the metabolic fate of ethiodized oil in either man or animals. However, the fate of ethiodized oil following Iymphangiography in dogs has been reported. Koehler et al. employed I131-tagged ethiodol for lymphangiography in dogs and analyses of individual organs at various time intervals were done. The investigators reported an average of only 25% of the injected medium was retained in the lymphatics at the end of three days. An average of 50% was recovered from the lungs. They found the remainder of injected activity was fairly uniformly distributed throughout the body. Urinary excretion in the form of inorganic iodine was revealed as the chief mode of iodine loss from the system. Mechanism of action: Ethiodized oil is selectively retained in tumor vessels for long periods, and is used for imaging organs such as liver, lung, stomach, and thyroid. Labeled with I-131 or other beta emitters (Y-90 or P-32), ethiodized oil can deliver a high internal radiation dose to certain tumors with minimal effect on healthy tissues. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antineoplastic Agents. Contrast Media"}}
