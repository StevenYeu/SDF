It enters the cerebellum through the superior cerebellar peduncle.  It arises from cell bodies located in the intermediate and ventral gray matter in the lower half of the spinal cord (Heimer, L:  The Human Brain and Spinal Cord, 1995, pg 370).  It crosses the midline at the segmental level and recrosses in the cerebellum.  Its terminals are distributed in the cerebellar anterior lobe, preferentially in the ipsilateral intermediate cortex.  Rostrally, it extends to lobule II.  The equivalent pathway from the cervical cord is the rostral spinocerebellar tract (Heimer, L:  The Human Brain and Spinal Cord, 1995, pg 370)"}}
