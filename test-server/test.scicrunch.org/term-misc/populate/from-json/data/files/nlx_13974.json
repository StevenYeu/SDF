These channels are activated by voltage but differ from the purely voltage-gated K+ channels because their voltage range of activation is modulated by different intracellular fac- tors3. SLO-1 channels are sensitive to Ca2+ (refs. 4\u20137), and mouse SLO-3 (mSLO-3) channels to pH8. We now report that C. elegans SLO-2 channels are sensitive to Cl\u2013 as well as Ca2+."}}
