(From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p277) Pharmacology: Chlorpropamide, a second-generation sulfonylurea antidiabetic agent, is used with diet to lower blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes mellitus type II. Chlorpropamide is twice as potent as the related second-generation agent glipizide. Mechanism of action: Sulfonylureas such as Chlorpropamide likely bind to ATP-sensitive potassium-channel receptors on the pancreatic cell surface, reducing potassium conductance and causing depolarization of the membrane. Depolarization stimulates calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels, raising intracellular concentrations of calcium ions, which induces the secretion, or exocytosis, of insulin. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Hypoglycemic Agents. Sulfonylureas"}}
