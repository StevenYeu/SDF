The cDNA coding for rasburicase was cloned from a strain of Aspergillus flavus. Pharmacology: Drugs used to treat lympohoid leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and acute myelogenous leukemia often lead to the accumulation of toxic plasma levels of purine metabolites (i.e. uric acid). The injection of rasburicase reduces levels of uric acid and mitigates the toxic effects of chemotherapy induced tumor lysis. Mechanism of action: Rasburicase catalyzes enzymatic oxidation of uric acid into an inactive and soluble metabolite (allantoin). Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Antihyperuricemic Agents"}}
