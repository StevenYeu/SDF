It belongs to the phenanthrene class of compounds that includes quinine and lumefantrine. It appears to inhibit polymerisation of heme molecules (by the parasite enzyme \"heme polymerase\"), resulting in the parasite being poisoned by its own waste. Halofantrine has been shown to preferentially block open and inactivated HERG channels leading to some degree of cardiotoxicity. Pharmacology: Halofantrine is a synthetic antimalarial which acts as a blood schizonticide. It is effective against multi drug resistant (including mefloquine resistant) P. falciparum malaria. Mechanism of action: The mechanism of action of Halofantrine may be similar to that of chloroquine, quinine, and mefloquine; by forming toxic complexes with ferritoporphyrin IX that damage the membrane of the parasite. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antimalarials. Antiprotozoals"}}
