It is sold under the brand name Sanctura in the US, and as Trosec in Canada. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Trospium is an antispasmodic, antimuscarinic agent indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. Receptor assays showed that trospium has negligible affinity for nicotinic receptors as compared to muscarinic receptors at concentrations obtained from therapeutic doses. Mechanism of action: Trospium antagonizes the effect of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors in cholinergically innervated organs. Its parasympatholytic action reduces the tonus of smooth muscle in the bladder. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Analgesics. Parasympatholytics"}}
