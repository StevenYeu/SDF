The A30P mutation disrupts an alpha-helical structure in the N-terminal region of the wild type alpha-synuclein.  This mutation accelerates alpha-synuclein oligomerization, decreases the rate of mature fibril formation, reduces cellular activity, and reduces cellular affinity for lipids.  It has an early onset and a slightly faster aggregation than wild type alpha-synuclein.  Drosophila displaying this mutation show symptoms of Parkinson's disease and are used in the laboratory to study this disorder."}}
