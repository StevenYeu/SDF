Encainide hydrochloride, formerly marketed as Enkaid capsules, was associated with increased death rates in patients who had asymptomatic heart rhythm abnormalities after a recent heart attack. The manufacturer of Enkaid capsules voluntarily withdrew the product from the US market on December 16, 1991. Pharmacology: Used to treat irregular heartbeats, encainide decreases excitability, conduction velocity, and automaticity as a result of slowed atrial, atrioventricular (AV) nodal, His-Purkinje, and intraventricular conduction. It causes a slight but significant prolongation of refractory periods in these tissues. The greatest effect is on the His-Purkinje system. Encainide decreases the rate of rise of the action potential without markedly affecting its duration. Mechanism of action: Encainide is a sodium channel blocker, binding to voltage gated sodium channels. It stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. Ventricular excitability is depressed and the stimulation threshold of the ventricle is increased during diastole. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Withdrawn. Drug category: Anti-Arrhythmia Agents. Antiarrhythmic Agents. Sodium channel blockers"}}
