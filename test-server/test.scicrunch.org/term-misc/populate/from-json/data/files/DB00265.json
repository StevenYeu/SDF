It is a colorless to slightly yellowish oil, having a faint amine-like odor. It is miscible with alcohol and with methanol. Pharmacology: Crotamiton is usually used to treat pruritis (itching of the skin) caused by scabies or sunburn. Crotamiton relieves itching by producing what is called a counter-irritation.
