{"Dorzolamide":{"RelatedTo":"Carbonic anhydrase 2","SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB00869","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB00869","Definition":"Dorzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. It is used in ophthalmic solutions (Trusopt) to lower increased intraocular pressure in open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Pharmacology: Dorzolamide is topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Dorzolamide is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who are insufficiently responsive to beta-blockers. Mechanism of action: Dorzolamide is a sulfonamide and a human carbonic anhydrase II inhibitor. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase II in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion, presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antihypertensive Agents. Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors"}}
