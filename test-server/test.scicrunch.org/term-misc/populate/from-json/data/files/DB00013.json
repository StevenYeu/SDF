Recombinant urokinase plasminogen activator Pharmacology: Urokinase is used for the treatment of pulmonary embolisms. The low molecular weight form of human urokinase consists of an A chain of 2,000 daltons linked by a sulfhydryl bond to a B chain of 30,400 daltons. Urokinase is an enzyme (protein) produced by the kidney, and found in the urine. There are two forms of urokinase which differ in molecular weight but have similar clinical effects. Urokinase is the low molecular weight form. Urokinase acts on the endogenous fibrinolytic system. It converts plasminogen to the enzyme plasmin. Plasmin degrades fibrin clots as well as fibrinogen and some other plasma proteins. Mechanism of action: Urokinase acts on the endogenous fibrinolytic system. It cleaves the Arg-Val bond in plasminogen to produce active plasmin. Plasmin degrades fibrin clots as well as fibrinogen and other plasma proteins. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Thrombolytic Agents"}}
