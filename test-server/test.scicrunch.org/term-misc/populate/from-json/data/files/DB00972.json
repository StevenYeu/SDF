Pharmacology: Azelastine is a relatively selective histamine H1 antagonist and an inhibitor of the release of histamine and other mediators from cells (e.g. mast cells) involved in the allergic response. Based on in vitro studies using human cell lines, inhibition of other mediators involved in allergic reactions (e.g. leukotrienes and PAF) has been demonstrated with azelastine. Decreased chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils has also been demonstrated. Mechanism of action: Antihistamines such as azelastine appear to compete with histamine for histamine H1- receptor sites on effector cells (mast cells). The antihistamines antagonize those pharmacological effects of histamine which are mediated through activation of H1- receptor sites and thereby reduce the intensity of allergic reactions and tissue injury response involving histamine release.
