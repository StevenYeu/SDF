The DJ-1 mutant helps to protect the organism from oxidative stress.  This fly model is viable, fertile, and has a normal number of dopaminergic neurons.  However, it has increased sensitivity to oxidative stress and chemical agents.  This mutant drosophila is being used in the laboratory to uncover the role of enviornmental toxins acting through oxdative stress on Parkinson's disease."}}
