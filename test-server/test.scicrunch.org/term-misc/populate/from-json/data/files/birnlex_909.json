The mouse was produced in the laboratory of Dr. Eliezer Masliah.       * From cited reference:\"For the present study, we generated tg mice expressing h-synuclein under the mThy-1 (Fig. 1A) cassette (provided by Dr. H. van der Putten, Ciba-Geigy, Basel, Switzerland)...The wt h-synuclein cDNA fragment (nt 53-475; Genbank accession No. L08850) was generated by RT-PCR from human brain mRNA, ligated into pCRII (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA), and sequenced for accuracy. In addition, PCR-based mutagenesis was used to generate the A30P mutant h-synuclein cDNA fragment. The h-synuclein cDNA fragments were released from the pCRII vector and inserted into the mThy-1 expression cassette between exons 2 and 4 (Fig. 1A), purified, and microinjected into one-cell embryos (C57BL\/6 x DBA\/2F1) according to standard procedures....For the mThy-1 promoter...Mice expressing mThy-1-h-synuclein (wt; line 61) showed the highest levels of expression, equivalent to tenfold the human levels, followed by the mThy-1-synuclein (A30P) tg mice (line 44).\""}}
