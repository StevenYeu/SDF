Eminase is a lyophilized (freeze-dried) formulation of anistreplase, the p-anisoyl derivative of the primary Lys-plasminogen-streptokinase activator complex (a complex of Lys-plasminogen and streptokinase). A p-anisoyl group is chemically conjugated to a complex of bacterial-derived streptokinase and human Plasma-derived Lys-plasminogen proteins. Pharmacology: Anistreplase cleaves the Arg\/Val bond in plasminogen to form plasmin. Plasmin in turn degrades the fibrin matrix of the thrombus, thereby exerting its thrombolytic action. This helps eliminate blood clots or arterial blockages that cause myocardial infarction. Mechanism of action: Anistreplase cleaves the Arg\/Val bond in plasminogen to form plasmin. This in turn leads to the degradation of blood clots. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Thrombolytic Agents"}}
