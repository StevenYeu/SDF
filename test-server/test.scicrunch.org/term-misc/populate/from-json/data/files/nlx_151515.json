The axial hindbrain can be easily segmented on coronal or sagittal T2-weighted MRI, as it is comprised largely of myelinated fibers, which appear as very dark well-defined areas. The rostral protrusion of the hindbrain, the interpeduncular nucleus, appears as a light ellipse just medial to the substantia nigra. The trigeminothalamic tracts and the medial lemnisci emerge as a dark triangle just lateral to the interpeduncular nucleus. Moving caudally through the pontine nuclei the border between the midbrain and hindbrain moves dorsally as a horizontal line between the ventral-most extents of the inferior colliculi, or just above the very dark medial longitudinal fasciculus. Even further caudally this border sits just ventral to the fourth ventricle. The border between the hindbrain and cerebellum is defined mostly by the borders of the fourth ventricle. The major difficulty is in deciding how to divide the cerebellar peduncles, which traverse the cerebellum\/hindbrain border. One solution is to follow a best-fit line between the vestibular nuclei medially and the cochlear nuclei laterally and use that as a dividing line between cerebellum and hindbrain. The caudal-most border between the hindbrain and spinal cord is defined by the caudal boundary of the pyramidal decussation."}}
