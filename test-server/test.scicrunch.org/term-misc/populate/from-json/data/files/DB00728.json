It is indicated for inpatients and outpatients as an adjunct to general anesthesia to facilitate both rapid sequence and routine tracheal intubation, and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. Pharmacology: Rocuronium is a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with a rapid to intermediate onset depending on dose and intermediate duration Mechanism of action: Rocuronium competes with acetylcholine (ACh) molecules and binds to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors on the post-synaptic membrane of the motor endplate. It blocks the action of ACh and prevents activation of the muscle contraction process. It can also act on nicotinic presynaptic acetylcholine receptors which inhibits the release of ACh. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Neuromuscular Nondepolarizing Agents. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants"}}
