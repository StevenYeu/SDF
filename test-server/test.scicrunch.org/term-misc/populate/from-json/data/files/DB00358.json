{"Mefloquine":{"RelatedTo":"Hemoglobin subunit alpha","Synonym":["Mefloquine HCL","Mefloquine aziridine","Mefloquinone"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB00358","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB00358","Definition":"A phospholipid-interacting antimalarial drug (antimalarials).  It is very effective against plasmodium falciparum with very few side effects. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Mefloquine is an antimalarial agent which acts as a blood schizonticide. Mefloquine is active against the erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium species. However, the drug has no effect against the exoerythrocytic (hepatic) stages of the parasite. Mefloquine is effective against malaria parasites resistant to chloroquine. Mefloquine is a chiral molecule. According to some research, the (+) enantiomer is more effective in treating malaria, and the (-) enantiomer specifically binds to adenosine receptors in the central nervous system, which may explain some of its psychotropic effects. Mechanism of action: Mefloquine has been found to produce swelling of the Plasmodium falciparum food vacuoles. It may act by forming toxic complexes with free heme that damage membranes and interact with other plasmodial components. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antimalarials"}}
