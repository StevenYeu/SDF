Synagis is a composite of human (95%) and murine (5%) antibody sequences. The human heavy chain sequence was derived from the constant domains of human IgG1 and the variable framework regions of the VH genes Cor (1) and Cess (2). The human lightchain sequence was derived from the constant domain of Ck and the variable framework regions of the VL gene K104 withJk-4. Palivizumab is expressed from a stable murine (mouse) myeloma cell line (NS0). Palivizumab is composed of to heavy chains (50.6 kDa each) and two light chains (27.6 kDa each), contains 1-2% carbohydrate by weight and has a molecular weight of 147.7 kDa +\/- 1 kDa (MALDI-TOF) Pharmacology: Synagis exhibits neutralizing and fusion-inhibitory activity against Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These activities inhibit RSV replication or spread. Synagis is given to prevent the development of lower respiratory tract disease in pediatric patients. Mechanism of action: Binds to the outer coat or Fusion glycoprotein of RSV. This prevents its binding and uptake by host cellular receptors. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Antiviral Agents"}}
