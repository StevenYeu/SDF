It is white, odorless, and stable in air. It is practically insoluble in water, sparingly soluble in acetone, slightly soluble in methanol, ether and vegetable oils. Federal (U.S.A.) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. Pharmacology: Used to treat adrenocortical insufficiency, desoxycorticosterone pivalate is a mineralocorticoid hormone and an analogue of desoxycorticosterone. It primarily acts on the metabolism of sodium, potassium and water. When the drug is given, there is decreased excretion of sodium accompanied by increased excretion of potassium; the concentration of sodium in the blood is thereby increased whereas that of potassium is decreased. There is a concomitant increase in the volume of blood and extracellular fluids, with a fall in hematocrit. It increases the rate of renal tubular absorption of sodium. Mechanism of action: Desoxycorticosterone Pivalate binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor. Mineralocorticoids are a family of steroids, secreted by the adrenal cortex, necessary for the regulation of a number of metabolic processes including electrolyte regulation. Desoxycorticosterone pivalate exerts its effect through its interaction with the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), whereby it reacts with the receptor proteins to form a steroid-receptor complex. This complex moves into the nucleus, where it binds to chromatin which results in genetic transcription of cellular DNA to messenger RNA. The steroid hormones appear to induce transcription and synthesis of specific proteins, which produce the physiological effects seen after administration. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Addison Agents. Diuretics"}}
