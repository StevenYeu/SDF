It has been used investigationally in combination with other antimycobacterial drugs to treat Mycobacterium avium infections in AIDS patients. Clofazimine also has a marked anti-inflammatory effect and is given to control the leprosy reaction, erythema nodosum leprosum. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1993, p1619) Pharmacology: Clofazimine exerts a slow bactericidal effect on Mycobacterium leprae (Hansen's bacillus). Clofazimine inhibits mycobacterial growth and binds preferentially to mycobacterial DNA. Clofazimine also exerts antiinflammatory properties in controlling erythema nodosum leprosum reactions. Clofazimine is highly lipophilic and tends to be deposited predominantly in fatty tissue and in cells of the reticuloendothelial system. It is taken up by macrophages throughout the body. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of clofazimine against leprosy bacilli in vitro is not yet feasible. In the mouse footpad system, the multiplication of M.leprae is inhibited by introducing 0.0001%- 0.001% clofazimine in the diet. Although bacterial killing may begin shortly after starting the drug, it cannot be measured in biopsy tissues taken from patients for mouse footpad studies until approximately 50 days after the start of therapy. Mechanism of action: Appears to preferentially bind to mycobacterial DNA leading to disruption of the cell cycle and eventually kills the bacterium. It may also bind to bacterial potassium transporters, thereby inhibiting their function. Lysophospholipids have been found to mediate the activity of this drug. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule.
