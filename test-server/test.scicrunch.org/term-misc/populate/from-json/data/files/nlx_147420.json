Its cell body, situated in the cortex above the calyx of the mushroom body, is smaller than those in the surrounding midbrain cortex. Four short fascicles extend from the cell bodies of the Kenyon cells into the calyx. Each fascicle corresponds to axons from a set of cell bodies descended from a single mushroom body neuroblast. These 4 smaller fascicles converge in the calyx where they arborize and form pre- and post-synaptic terminals (Christiansen et al., 2011).They emerge from the calyx as a thick axon bundle referred to as the peduncle that bifurcates to innervate the dorsal and medial lobes of the mushroom body.","hasDBXref":"VFB:FBbt_00003686"}}
