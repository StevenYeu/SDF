{"Filter order":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Filter","Id":"oen_0001227","Definition":"the order of a filter describes the number of poles.  The order is often described as the slope of the attenuation in the stop band, so that the slope of the attenuation has approached its asymptotic value.  Typically, the higher the order of the filter, the less the attenuation in the pass band.  (adapted from the Axon Guide)"}}
