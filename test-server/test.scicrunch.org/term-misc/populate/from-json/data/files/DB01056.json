(PubChem) Pharmacology: Tocainide is a primary amine analog of lidocaine with antiarrhythmic properties useful in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. Tocainide, like lidocaine, produces dose dependent decreases in sodium and potassium conductance, thereby decreasing the excitability of myocardial cells. In experimental animal models, the dose-related depression of sodium current is more pronounced in ischemic tissue than in normal tissue. Tocainide is a Class I antiarrhythmic compound with electrophysiologic properties in man similar to those of lidocaine, but dissimilar from quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide. Mechanism of action: Tocainide acts on sodium channels on the neuronal cell membrane, limiting the spread of seizure activity and reducing seizure propagation. The antiarrhythmic actions are mediated through effects on sodium channels in Purkinje fibers. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Arrhythmia Agents. Sodium channel blockers"}}
