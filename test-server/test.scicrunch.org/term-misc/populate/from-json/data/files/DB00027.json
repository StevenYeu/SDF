{"Gramicidin D":{"Synonym":["Neosporin"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB00027","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB00027","Definition":"15 residue peptide isolated from Bacillus brevis. With alternating D and L amino acids Pharmacology: Gramicidin is particularly effective against gram-positive bacteria. Because the drug is highly hemolytic, it cannot be administered internally and so is used only on the skin as a lotion or ointment. It is used primarily in the treatment of infected surface wounds, and in eye, nose, and throat infections. It is normally given with two other antibiotics (neomycin and polymixin B) as an ophthalmic solution Mechanism of action: Gramicidin D binds to and inserts itself into bacterial membranes (with a strong preference to gram-positive cell membranes). This results in membrane disruption and permeabilization. This leads to (i) loss of intracellular solutes (e.g., K+ and amino acids); (ii) dissipation of the transmembrane potential; (iii) inhibition of respiration; (iv) a reduction in ATP pools; and (v) inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, which leads to cell death. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Anti-Infectives. Antibiotic Agents. Antibiotics. Ophthalmic Antibiotic. Topical Antibiotic"}}
