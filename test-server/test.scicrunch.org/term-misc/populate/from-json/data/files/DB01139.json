(PubChem) Pharmacology: Cephapirin is a first-generation cephalosporin that has a wide spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cephapirin is more resistant to beta-lactamases than are the penicillins and so is effective against staphylococci, with the exception of methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Mechanism of action: The bactericidal activity of cephapirin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents. Cephalosporins"}}
