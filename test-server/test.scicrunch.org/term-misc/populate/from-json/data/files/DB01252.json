Pharmacology: Mitiglinide belongs to the meglitinide class of blood glucose-lowering drugs. It is approved for use in Japan but has not yet gained FDA approval. Mechanism of action: Mitiglinide is a novel antidiabetic agent for the treatment of type-2 diabetes mellitus. Its chemical structure is similar to that of sulphonylureas. Mitiglinide exerts a hypoglycaemic effect with rapid onset and short duration of action, by transiently increasing insulin secretion. Mitiglinide is thought to stimulate insulin secretion by closing the ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels (Kir6.2\/SUR1 complex, KATP channels) in pancreatic beta-cells. Mitiglinide may also activate ryanodine receptors. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Hypoglycemic Agents"}}
