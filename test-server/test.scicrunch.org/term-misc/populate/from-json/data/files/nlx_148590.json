The cell body fiber runs dorsomedially to the opposite hemisphere. The fiber from the opposite hemisphere runs laterally and bifurcates behind the tip of the beta' lobe. One of the fibers runs ventrally and enters the medial-most part of the beta lobe where it arborizes through the tip of the beta-p lobe to the lateral part of the beta lobe segment. The other fiber runs dorsolaterally towards the tip region of the vertical lobe and terminates in the superior neuropils. On the way, the fiber bifurcates and one of the branches terminates in the tip of the alpha' lobe.","hasDBXref":"FlyBrain_NDB:10467"}}
