{"Protein structure classification":{"Synonym":"protein classification","Created":"2007-10-10","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Sequence-based model","Id":"birnlex_2318","Definition":"A mathematical description of the related structural domains of a collection of amino acid sequence based on the consensus sequences with defined structural properties (e.g., alpha helix, beta sheet, etc.).  These models are typically used to infer phylogenetic relatedness of proteins (families\/superfamilies) based on structural properties."}}
