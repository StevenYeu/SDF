(Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Oxiconazole is a broad-spectrum imidazole derivative whose antifungal activity is derived primarily from the inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, which is critical for cellular membrane integrity. It has fungicidal or fungistatic activity in vitro against a number of pathogenic fungi including the following dermatophytes, and yeasts: T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, T. violaceum, E. floccosum, M. canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum, C. albicans, and M. furfur. Mechanism of action: Oxiconazole inhibits ergosterol biosynthesis, which is required for cytoplasmic membrane integrity of fungi. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antifungal Agents"}}
