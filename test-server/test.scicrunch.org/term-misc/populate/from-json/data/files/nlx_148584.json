The cell body fiber projects anterior-medially and forms branches in the superior neuropils posterior to the vertical lobes. One of these branches projects to the opposite hemisphere and others project to the vertical lobe and form extensive arborizations in the middle segment of both the alpha and alpha' lobes.","hasDBXref":"FlyBrain_NDB:10461"}}
