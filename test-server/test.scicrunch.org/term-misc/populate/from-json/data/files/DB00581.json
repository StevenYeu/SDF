It has also been used in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal disorders. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p887) Pharmacology: Therapeutically, lactulose has laxative and ammonia-detoxifying actions. In treating constipation lactulose metabolites draw water into the bowel, causing a cathartic effect through osmotic action. Mechanism of action: Lactulose is a synthetic sugar used in the treatment of constipation and liver disease. It consists of the monosaccharides fructose and galactose. In the colon, lactulose is broken down primarily to lactic acid, and also to small amounts of formic and acetic acids, by the action of via evolved-beta galactosidase from colonic bacteria, which results in an increase in osmotic pressure and slight acidification of the colonic contents. This in turn causes an increase in stool water content and softens the stool. In treating heptic diseases (hepatic encephalopathy) it is thought that lactulose draws out ammonia from the body in the same way that it draws out water into the colon. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Gastrointestinal Agents"}}
