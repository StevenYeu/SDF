{"Cerivastatin":{"RelatedTo":"3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase","Synonym":["Cerivastatin sodium","Cerivastatin","sodium salt","Baycol","Lipobay"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB00439","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB00439","Definition":"On August 8, 2001 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that Bayer Pharmaceutical Division voluntarily withdrew Baycol from the U.S. market, due to reports of fatal Rhabdomyolysis, a severe adverse reaction from this cholesterol-lowering (lipid-lowering) product. It has also been withdrawn from the Canadian market. Pharmacology: Cerivastatin, a competitive HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor effective in lowering LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, is used to treat primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson types IIa and IIb). Mechanism of action: Cerivastatin competitively inhibits hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the hepatic enzyme responsible for converting HMG-CoA to mevalonate. As mevalonate is a precursor of sterols such as cholesterol, this results in a decrease in cholesterol in hepatic cells, upregulation of LDL-receptors, and an increase in hepatic uptake of LDL-cholesterol from the circulation. Drug type: Small Molecule. Withdrawn. Drug category: Anticholesteremic Agents. Antilipemic Agents. Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors"}}
