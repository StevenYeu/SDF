{"European Union":{"Synonym":"EU","CurationStatus":"uncurated","ExampleImage":["EU.PNG"],"SuperCategory":"Government granting agency","Id":"nlx_67420","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/europa.eu\/index_en.htm","Abbrev":"EU","Definition":"The European Union is a unique economic and political partnership between 27 European countries. It has delivered half a century of peace, stability, and prosperity, helped raise living standards, launched a single European currency, and is progressively building a single Europe-wide market in which people, goods, services, and capital move among Member States as freely as within one country. The EU provides funding and grants for a broad range of projects and programs. The EU was created in the aftermath of the second world war. The first steps were to foster economic cooperation: countries that trade with one another are economically interdependent and will thus avoid conflict.Since then, the union has developed into a huge single market with the euro as its common currency. What began as a purely economic union has evolved into an organization spanning all areas, from development aid to environmental policy."}}
