(PubChem) Pharmacology: Verapamil, a class IV antiarrhythmic agent, is used as a calcium-channel blocking (CCB) agent for the treatment of angina, hypertension, and for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Mechanism of action: Possibly by deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and\/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, verapamil, like diltiazem, inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across both the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes. The resultant inhibition of the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells leads to dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries,improved oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, and decreased total peripheral resistance, systemic blood pressure, and afterload. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Arrhythmia Agents. Antiarrhythmic Agents. Calcium Channel Blockers. Calcium-channel blocking agents. Vasodilator Agents"}}
