{"Mozilla Public License":{"Created":"2007-10-11","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Open-source license","Id":"birnlex_2348","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.mozilla.org\/MPL\/MPL-1.1.html","Xref":"NITRC_537","Abbrev":"MPL","Definition":"A free and open source software license characterized as a hybridization of the modified BSD license and GNU General Public License. NITRC definition: The Mozilla license was developed originally for the Mozilla project. It differs from other projects, and more closely reflects my redistribution wishes, in the following ways:Similar to the LGPL, it allows incorporation into closed source software, but the part that is kept open source and requires redistribution to the community is based on a programming unit, usually a class, or possibly a header file. Thus it does not require arbitrary division of the program into libraries.  This is particularly important in this case, as it would allow someone to attach a closed source library to this program (rather than the other way round)."}}
