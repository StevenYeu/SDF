{"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential":{"Synonym":["Inhibitory post-synaptic potential","IPSP"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Membrane potential","Id":"oen_0001261","Xref":"nlx_qual_20090502","Definition":"A temporary change in postsynaptic membrane potential, resulting from presynaptic release of neurotransmitter that has the effect of moving the membrane potential farther from threshold, reducing the probability of transmitter release, or limiting the effectiveness of excitatory inputs.  Typically this is an increase in postsynaptic potential, or hyperpolarization, but depolarizing or nonpolarizing potentials can also be considered inhibitory if they reduce the likelihood of action potential firing.  Hyperpolarization can be the result of several types of ionic changes including an increase of negative charged ions into the cell, an increase in positively charged ions out of the cell, or a decrease of positively charged ions into the cell.  Normally, Chloride is the negative charge carrier and the activation of chloride conductances underlies an inhibitory postsynaptic potential."}}
