One of the three dendrites originate from the apical pole of soma, which then branch profusely, ascend through stratum radiatum, and often penetrate stratum lacunosum-moelculare. Primary basal dendrites are more numerous. They also branch close to soma and fan out toward the alveus, spanning the entire depth of stratum oriens."}}
