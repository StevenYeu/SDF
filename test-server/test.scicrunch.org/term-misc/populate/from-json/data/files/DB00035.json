It increases urine concentration and decreases urine production. Desmopressin is used to prevent and control excessive thirst, urination, and dehydration caused by injury, surgery, and certain medical conditions, allowing you to sleep through the night without awakening to urinate. It is also used to treat specific types of diabetes insipidus and conditions after head injury or pituitary surgery. Pharmacology: Desmopressin is a synthetic analogue of the natural pituitary hormone 8-arginine vasopressin (ADH), an antidiuretic hormone affecting renal water conservation. Desmopressin is indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central diabetes insipidus and for the management of the temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region and is also indicated for the management of primary nocturnal enuresis. Mechanism of action: Desmopressin emulates the actions of the natural pituitary hormone 8-arginine vasopressin (ADH). Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Antidiuretic Agents. Hemostatics.
