Bundles of 3 or 4 horizontal fiber system neurons connect each glomerulus to a fan-shaped body segment and then run horizontally in layer 4 where they arborize in all 4 shells. Arborizations in the protocerebral bridge are spiny, terminals in the ventral bodies are blebs, both types of terminals are formed in the fan-shaped body."}}
