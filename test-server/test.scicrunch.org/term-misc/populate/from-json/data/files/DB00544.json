It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Fluorouracil is an antineoplastic anti-metabolite. Anti-metabolites masquerade as purine or pyrimidine - which become the building blocks of DNA. They prevent these substances becoming incorporated in to DNA during the \"S\" phase (of the cell cycle), stopping normal development and division. Fluorouracil blocks an enzyme which converts the cytosine nucleotide into the deoxy derivative. In addition, DNA synthesis is further inhibited because Fluorouracil blocks the incorporation of the thymidine nucleotide into the DNA strand. Mechanism of action: Fluorouracil inhibits thymidylate synthetase, leading to inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis and cell death. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antimetabolites. Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic. Antineoplastic Agents. Immunosuppressive Agents"}}
