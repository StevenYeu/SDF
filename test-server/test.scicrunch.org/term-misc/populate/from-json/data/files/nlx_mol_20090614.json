{"Excitotoxin":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Neurotoxin","Id":"nlx_mol_20090614","Definition":"Compounds that act to damage or kill nerve cells through the process of excitotoxicity. Excitotoxicity occurs when receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate such as the NMDA receptor and AMPA receptor are overactivated. Excitotoxins like NMDA and kainic acid which bind to these receptors, as well as pathologically high levels of glutamate, can cause excitotoxicity by allowing high levels of calcium ions[1] (Ca2+) to enter the cell. Ca2+ influx into cells activates a number of enzymes, including phospholipases, endonucleases, and proteases such as calpain. These enzymes go on to damage cell structures such as components of the cytoskeleton, membrane, and DNA. (Adapted from Wikipedia)"}}
