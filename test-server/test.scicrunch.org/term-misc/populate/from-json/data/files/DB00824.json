Enprofylline is used in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and in the management of cerebrovascular insufficiency, sickle cell disease, and diabetic neuropathy. Long-term enprofylline administration may be associated with elevation in liver enzyme levels and unpredictable blood levels. Pharmacology: Enprofylline is a synthetic dimethylxanthine derivative structurally related to theophylline and caffeine. It antagonizes erythrocyte phosphodiesterase, increasing cAMP activity. Mechanism of action: Enprofylline inhibits erythrocyte phosphodiesterase, resulting in an increase in erythrocyte cAMP activity. Subsequently, the erythrocyte membrane becomes more resistant to deformity. Along with erythrocyte activity, enprofylline also decreases blood viscosity by reducing plasma fibrinogen concentrations and increasing fibrinolytic activity. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Asthmatic Agents. Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal. Antiarrhythmic Agents. Bronchodilator Agents"}}
