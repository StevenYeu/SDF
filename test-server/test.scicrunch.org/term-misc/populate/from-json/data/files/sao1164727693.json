{"Glutamate receptor":{"RelatedTo":["Glutamate"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Neurotransmitter Receptor","Id":"sao1164727693","Is part of":"Glutamatergic system","Definition":"Cell-surface proteins that bind glutamate and trigger changes which influence the behavior of cells. Glutamate receptors include ionotropic receptors (AMPA, kainate, and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors), which directly control ion channels, and metabotropic receptors which act through second messenger systems. Glutamate receptors are the most common mediators of fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. They have also been implicated in the mechanisms of memory and of many diseases (MSH)."}}
