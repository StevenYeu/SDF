{"Oligodendrocyte Paranodal Termination":{"Synonym":"Paranodal loop","SuperCategory":"Oligodendrocyte Myelin Sheath","Id":"sao1354781919","Definition":"Cytoplasmic pockets, or as they appear in thin sections \"loops\" formed by the Schwann cell in the paranodal region.  These pockets are actually part of a continuous helical structure providing cytoplasmic continuity from the inntermost to the outermost layers of the myelin sheath through the cytoplasmic channel formed by the loop.  Most are directly apposed to the paranodal axonal membrane"}}
