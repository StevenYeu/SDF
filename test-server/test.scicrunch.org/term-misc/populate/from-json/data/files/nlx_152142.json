There is classical evidence that the dendrite connects to cones and axon arborization connects to rods, and that the axon does not support an action potential but serves to separate the two arborizations.  However, this issue is under investigation.  This cell type has a narrow receptive field and connects weakly to other horizontal cells.","DefinitionPMID":["Demb and Sterling"]}}
