{"Resting Membrane potential":{"Synonym":["resting voltage","resting potential","V<sub>rest<\/sub>","V<sub>m<\/sub>","RMP"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Membrane potential","Id":"oen_0001268","Has role":"NeuroElectro Term","Xref":"nlx_qual_20090503","Definition":"A quality inhering in a cell's plasma membrane by virtue of the electric potential difference across it during the resting state of the cell.  This resting state usually implies that the potassium current dominates membrane potential."}}
