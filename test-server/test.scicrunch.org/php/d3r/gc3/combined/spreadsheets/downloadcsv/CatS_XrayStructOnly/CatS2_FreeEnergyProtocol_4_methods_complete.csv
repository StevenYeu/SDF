Integrator : sd. Berendsen pressure coupling.  Parameter: Morphing : Short 50 ps MD at 300 K on 200 extracted conformations from state A and state B simulations.  Parameter: Morphing : sc-alpha = 0.5, sc-sigma = 0.25.  Parameter: Morphing : Integrator : md. Pressure coupling : berendsen. Temperature coupling : velocity rescale  Method: The protein used for free energy calculation was taken from the structure QJAN. Ligands 3D coordinates were obtained by docking using Glide and SP protocol, with constraints applied on the common substructure with either CatS_15, CatS_20 or CatS_24. Alchemical free energies were calculated using Gromacs and OPLS-AA force field, some scripts from the PMX software and some in house developed scripts. Hybrid structures and topologies were built using a modified version of the MOL2FF package developed in our team. CatS_67 was used as reference structure for the free energy calculations. Equilibrium 10 ns MD simulations were performed for the two states (corresponding to lambda 0 and 1), using Gromacs and OPLS-AA force field. Snapshots from the equilibrium runs were extracted to spawn 100 simulations of 50 ps each to alchemically morph between the two states of the system. The work values over every non-equilibrium transition were extracted and further used to estimate the free energy differences relying on the Crooks Fluctuation Theorem and utilizing Crooks-Gaussian Intersection as estimator.  Answer 1: Yes "
