(PubChem) Pharmacology: Cladribine is a synthetic antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressive effects. Cladribine is one of a group of chemotherapy drugs known as the anti-metabolites.Anti-metabolites stop cells making and repairing DNA. Cancer cells need to make and repair DNA in order to grow and multiply. Mechanism of action: Cladribine is structurally related to fludarabine and pentostatin but has a different mechanism of action. It is phosphorylated to its corresponding nucleotide CdATP, which accumulates and is incorporated into the DNA of cells such as lymphocytes. High levels of CdATP lead to DNA strand breaks, inhibition of DNA synthesis, and cell death. Unlike other antimetabolite drugs, cladribine has cytotoxic effects on resting as well as proliferating lymphocytes. However, it does cause cells to accumulate at the G1\/S phase junction, suggesting that cytotoxicity is associated with events critical to cell entry into S phase. It also binds purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), however no relationship between this binding and a mechanism of action has been established. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antineoplastic Agents. Immunosuppressive Agents"}}
