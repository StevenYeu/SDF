It is a naturally-occurring compound found in the soil bacterium Streptomyces roseosporus. Antibiotics are used in the treatment of infections caused by bacteria. They work by killing bacteria or preventing their growth. Daptomycin will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections. It was approved in September 2003 for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections. It has a safety profile similar to other agents commonly administered to treat gram-positive infections. Pharmacology: Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic active against Gram-positive bacteria only. It has proven in vitro activity against enterococci (including glycopeptide-resistant Enterococci (GRE)), staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), streptococci and corynebacteria. Mechanism of action: Daptomycin appears to bind or insert into the outer membrane of gram positive bacteria. This binding casues rapid depolarisation, resulting in a loss of membrane potential leading to inhibition of protein, DNA and RNA synthesis, which results in bacterial cell death. The bactericidal activity of daptomycin is concentration-dependent. There is in vitro evidence of synergy with -lactam antibiotics. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents"}}
