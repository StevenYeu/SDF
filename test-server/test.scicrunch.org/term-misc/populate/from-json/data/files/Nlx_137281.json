{"Thalamic relay nucleus":{"Synonym":["principal thalamic nucleus","principal nucleus"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Brain region role","Id":"Nlx_137281","Definition":"A thalamic nucleus that receives a well-defined subcortical input as part of one or the sensory or motor pathways whose cells project to the middle layers of a restricted region of cerebral cortex and receive a reciprocal projection from the same region of cortex.  This designation is based on an organizational scheme proposed by Jones (1985), although it is recognized to be an oversimplification of thalamic organization.
