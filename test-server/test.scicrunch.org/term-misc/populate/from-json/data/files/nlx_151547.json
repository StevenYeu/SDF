{"Corpus Callosum of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["corpus callosum p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151547","Is part of":"Major White Matter Structures of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"The corpus callosum, external capsule and deep cerebral white matter are most easily segmented on coronal T2-weighted MRI. This white matter structure is much darker that surrounding tissues and can be easily thresholded on a slice-by-slice basis. The dorsal border with the cingulum is defined by a fine, bright line that fades laterally as the two structures merge. This border is trivially easy to distinguish on color fractional anisotropy images as these two white matter tracts course virtually perpendicular to each other.  The rostral extent of the forceps minor is a comma-shaped dark region that appears in the center of the frontal cortex in the coronal plane. The caudal extent is a dark, diagonal strip just medial to the visual cortex."}}
