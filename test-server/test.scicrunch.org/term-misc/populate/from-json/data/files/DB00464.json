Pharmacology: Sodium tetradecyl sulfate is an anionic surfactant which occurs as a white, waxy solid. It is used as a sclerosing agent in sclerotherapy. Sclerotherapy is an injection of a sclerosing agent directly through the skin into a lesion and is used primarily for slow-flow vascular anomalies, particularly for venous malformation and lymphatic malformation. Intravenous injection causes intima inflammation and thrombus formation. This usually occludes the injected vein. Subsequent formation of fibrous tissue results in partial or complete vein obliteration that may or may not be permanent. Mechanism of action: Sodium tetradecyl sulfate is a potent toxin for endothelial cells in that brief exposure to even low concentrations are effective in stripping endothelium over a considerable distance and exposing highly thrombogenic endothelium in the process. Diluted sodium tetradecyl sulfate is also able to induce a hypercoagulable state, possibly by selective inhibition of protein C, and can also promote platelet aggregation. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Sclerosing Agents. Surface-Active Agents"}}
