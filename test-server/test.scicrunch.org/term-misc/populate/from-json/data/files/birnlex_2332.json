{"Part-of-speech tagging algorithm":{"Created":"2007-10-11","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Natural language processing algorithm","Id":"birnlex_2332","Value_Representation":"CS","Definition":"Part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging or POST), also called grammatical tagging, is the process of marking up the words in a text as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition, as well as its context, i.e., relationship with adjacent and related words in a phrase, sentence, or paragraph. A simplified form of this is commonly taught school-age children, in the identification of words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc. Once performed by hand, POS tagging is now done in the context of computational linguistics, using algorithms which associate discrete terms, as well as hidden parts of speech, in accordance with a set of descriptive tags."}}
