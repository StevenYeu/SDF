Pharmacology: Terfenadine, an H1-receptor antagonist antihistamine, is similar in structure to astemizole and haloperidol, a butyrophenone antipsychotic. The active metabolite of terfenadine is fexofenadine. Mechanism of action: Terfenadine competes with histamine for binding at H1-receptor sites in the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial muscle. This reversible binding of terfenadine to H1-receptors suppresses the formation of edema, flare, and pruritus resulting from histaminic activity. As the drug does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, CNS depression is minimal. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Withdrawn. Drug category: Anti-Allergic Agents. Antiarrhythmic Agents. Antihistamines. Histamine H1 Antagonists, Non-Sedating"}}
