{"Anterior Commissure of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["ac p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151545","Is part of":"Major White Matter Structures of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"The anterior commissure is very easily segmented on horizontal T2w MRI. The dense white matter of the anterior commissure is much darker than surrounding tissue on T2w MRI and the entire structure can be segmented using a simple seeded threshold (magic wand) tool. The posterior limbs tend to be slightly lighter than the anterior limbs, but are still readily distinguishable from surrounding tissue."}}
