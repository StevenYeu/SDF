Cells comprising this nucleus vary widely in size. Large cells appear to project ipsilaterally to the cerebellum.  The nucleus is a major site of termination for dorsal root fibers.  Petras and Cummings suggest that these cells give rise to the rostral spinocerebellar tract.","DefinitionPMID":"266509"}}
