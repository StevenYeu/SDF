It is produced widely via the oxidation of propene but is most often immediately reacted with other products due to its instability and toxicity. Acrolein is used as a pesticide to control algae, weeds, bacteria, and mollusks. It is also used to make other chemicals. Small amounts of acrolein can be formed when trees, tobacco, other plants, gasoline, and oil are burned."}}
