The Dentate gyrus IS-I class interneurons are visualized by immunostaining for Calretinin (CR) and establish multiple symmetrical synapses on the dendrites and somata of other CR-positive IS-I cells, Calbindin (CB) containing interneurons, and VIP-positive basket cells, but they do not innervate PV-containing interneurons. The dendrites of Dentate gyrus IS I neurons appear in all layers of Dentate gyrus and more characteristic feature of these dendrites is that they form long dendrodendritic junctions with each other."}}
