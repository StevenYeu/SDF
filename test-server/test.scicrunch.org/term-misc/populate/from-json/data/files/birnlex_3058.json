{"Region of Interest":{"Created":"2008-03-14","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Information content entity","Id":"birnlex_3058","Abbrev":"ROI","Definition":"A Region of Interest, often abbreviated ROI, is a selected subset of samples within a dataset identified for a particular purpose. The concept of an ROI is commonly used in medical imaging. For example, the boundaries of a tumor may be defined on an image or in a volume, for the purpose of measuring its size. The endocardial border may be defined on an image, perhaps during different phases of the cardiac cycle, say end-systole and end-diastole, for the purpose of assessing cardiac function.There are three fundamentally different means of encoding an ROI:     * burned in to the dataset, with a value that may or may not be outside the normal range of normally occurring values     * as separate purely graphic information, such as with vector or bitmap (rasterized) drawing elements, perhaps with some accompanying plain (unstructured) text annotation     * as separate structured semantic information (such as coded value types) with a set of spatial and\/or temporal coordinates (WIkiPedia)"}}
