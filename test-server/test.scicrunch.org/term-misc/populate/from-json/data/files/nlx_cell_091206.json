Andersen et al. \"The Hippocampus Book\" 2007","Definition":"CA1 Oriens Lacunosum Moleculare (O-LM) cell is a neuron, which is characterized as a non-pyramidal cell type and interneuron that is mostly immunoreactive to GABAergic markers with the soma and dendrites mainly located in the CA1 stratum oriens and alveus, and axons extend directly to the stratum lacunosum-moleculare, ramifying there to form a dense plexus, forming symmetrical inhibitory synapses with the distal apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons while receiving excitatory input from CA1 recurrent collaterals in a disynaptic, feedback manner."}}
