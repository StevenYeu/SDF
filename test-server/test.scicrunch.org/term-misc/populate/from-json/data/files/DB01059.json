Norfloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Norfloxacin is a quinolone\/fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Norfloxacin is bactericidal and its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Notably the drug has 100 times higher affinity for bacterial DNA gyrase than for mammalian. Mechanism of action: The bactericidal action of Norfloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. Norfloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterias. The fluorine atom at the 6 position increases potency against gram-negative organisms, and the piperazine moiety at the 7 position is responsible for anti-pseudomonal activity Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents. Anti-Infectives. Enzyme Inhibitors. Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors. Quinolones"}}
