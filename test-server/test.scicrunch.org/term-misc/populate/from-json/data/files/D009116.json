It is the first parasympathomimetic substance ever studied and causes profound parasympathetic activation that may end in convulsions and death. Muscarinic agonists, like this one and others, specifically effects the acetycholine (muscarinic) receptor subtypes. The specific antidote is atropine. Adapted from MSH"}}
