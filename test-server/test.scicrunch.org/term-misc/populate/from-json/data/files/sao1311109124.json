{"Electrotonic Synapse":{"Synonym":"Electrical Synapse","SuperCategory":"Synapse","Id":"sao1311109124","Definition":"Electrotonic synapses are gap junctions that allow the passage of ions directly from cell to cell.  Ultrastructurally, it can be recognized as a 7 layered structure with 4 dense lines, two from each of the plasma membranes, alternating with 3 lighter lines.  Electrotonic synapses are generally symmetric and display little or no dense material associated with the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane (Peters, Palay and Webster, 1991)."}}
