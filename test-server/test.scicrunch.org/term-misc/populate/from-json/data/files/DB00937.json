It is also considered to be among the safest for patients with hypertension. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p2290) Pharmacology: Diethylpropion is a sympathomimetic stimulant drug marketed as an appetite suppressant. Chemically, it is the N,N-diethyl analog of cathinone. Its mechanism of action is similar to other appetite suppressants such as sibutramine, phentermine and dextroamphetamine. Mechanism of action: Diethylpropion is an amphetamine that stimulates neurons to release or maintain high levels of a particular group of neurotransmitters known as catecholamines; these include dopamine and norepinephrine. High levels of these catecholamines tend to suppress hunger signals and appetite. Diethylpropion (through catecholamine elevation) may also indirectly affect leptin levels in the brain. It is theorized that diethylpropion can raise levels of leptin which signal satiety. It is also theorized that increased levels of the catecholamines are partially responsible for halting another chemical messenger known as neuropeptide Y. This peptide initiates eating, decreases energy expenditure, and increases fat storage. Drug type: Approved. Illicit. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anorexigenic Agents. Appetite Depressants.
