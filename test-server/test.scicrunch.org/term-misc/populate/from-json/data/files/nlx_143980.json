Lamina VI is mainly visible in the cervical and lumbar enlargements(Paxinos, The rat nervous system, 2nd ed, page 43).From Rexed:  \"[Lamina VI] occupies the base of the dorsal horn and has a slightly curved ventral surface. In the medial part of layer VI the nerve cells are smaller and more tightly packed than in the lateral part, where they are somewhat larger and not quite so numerous.\"  "}}
