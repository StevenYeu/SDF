When exposed to ultrasound waves, the microspheres resonate and \"echo\" strong signals back to the ultrasound machine. The difference in density between the gas-filled bubbles and the blood around them creates an increased level of contrast visible in the resulting ultrasound image. During echocardiography, activated Perflutren enhances images of the inner edges or borders of the heart, producing an improved image that may enable physicians to better diagnose patients. Pharmacology: Perflutren, a diagnostic drug that is intended to be used for contrast enhancement during the indicated echocardiographic procedures, comprised of lipid-coated microspheres filled with octafluoropropane(OFP) gas. It provide contrast enhancement of the endocardial borders during echocardiography. The perflutren lipid microspheres exhibit lower acoustic impedance than blood and enhance the intrinsic backscatter of blood. Mechanism of action: Perflutren is comprised of gas-filled microspheres that are injected or infused into the body. When exposed to ultrasound waves, the microspheres resonate and \"echo\" strong signals back to the ultrasound machine. The difference in density between the gas-filled bubbles and the blood around them creates an increased level of contrast visible in the resulting ultrasound image. During echocardiography, activated Perflutren enhances images of the inner edges or borders of the heart, producing an improved image that may enable physicians to better diagnose patients. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Contrast Media. Ultrasound contrast agent"}}
