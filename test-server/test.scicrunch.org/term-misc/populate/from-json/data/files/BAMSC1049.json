The shape and branching patterns of their dendritic trees resemble those of RGA2 cells, although dendritic fields are much smaller. The somata are centrally located within the dendritic field. RGB3 cells show a greater range in dendritic field sizes than other RGB subgroups (Fig. 9), which suggests further heteronegeitiy. RGB3 cells had curvy, recursive dendrites, forming a relatively sparse dendritic field (Fig. 5C)."}}
