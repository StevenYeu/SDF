Mature insulin granules are typically ~200-300 nm in diameter, and each contain 150000-280000 insulin molecules in mouse. The precursor of a mature insulin granule is an immature insulin granule, which is also known as a pale granule, as it lacks an electron dense core and is pale in appearance."}}
