Dromostanolone is indicated in postmenopausal women with recurrent breast cancer, in a combined hormone therapy. Pharmacology: Dromostanolone is a synthetic androgen, or male hormone, similar to testosterone. Dromostanolone works by attaching itself to androgen receptors; this causes it to interact with the parts of the cell involved in the making of proteins. It may cause an increase in the synthesis of some proteins or a decrease in the synthesis of others. These proteins have a variety of effects, including blocking the growth of some types of breast cancer cells, stimulating cells that cause male sexual characteristics, and stimulating the production of red blood cells. Mechanism of action: Dromostanolone is a synthetic androgenic anabolic steroid and is approximately 5 times as potent as natural methyltestosterone. Like testosterone and other androgenic hormones, dromostanolone binds to the androgen receptor. It produces retention of nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus; increases protein anabolism; and decreases amino acid catabolism. The antitumour activity of dromostanolone appears related to reduction or competitive inhibition of prolactin receptors or estrogen receptors or production. Drug type: Approved. Illicit.
