Immature insulin are also called \"pale granules\" due to their pale appearance under an transmission electron microscope. Immature insulin granules bud off the trans-most Golgi cisternae as part of the insulin synthesis process. When the proinsulin in converted to a mature form of insulin and clusters into an electron dense core, it is said to become an mature insulin granule."}}
