{"Epithelial Voltage Clamp":{"SuperCategory":"Amplifier","Comment":"Adapted from WPI http:\/\/www.wpiinc.com\/index.php\/Virtue-Mart\/vmchk.html","Id":"nlx_63656","Has role":"Instrument role","Definition":"Epithelial voltage and current clamp instruments are used to measure the potential across or current through an epithelial tissue mounted in a chamber preparation. These instruments allow the user to impose a fixed or controlled variation of voltage or current stimulation to the tissue while simultaneously measuring an independent variable of voltage or current in response to the applied stimulus."}}
