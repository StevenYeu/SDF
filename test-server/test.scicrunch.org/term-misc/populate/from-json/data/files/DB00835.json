(PubChem) Pharmacology: Brompheniramine is an antihistaminergic medication of the propylamine class. It is a first-generation antihistamine. In allergic reactions an allergen interacts with and cross-links surface IgE antibodies on mast cells and basophils. Once the mast cell-antibody-antigen complex is formed, a complex series of events occurs that eventually leads to cell-degranulation and the release of histamine (and other chemical mediators) from the mast cell or basophil. Once released, histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors. Histamine, acting on H1-receptors, produces pruritis, vasodilatation, hypotension, flushing, headache, tachycardia, and bronchoconstriction. Histamine also increases vascular permeability and potentiates pain. Brompheniramine is a histamine H1 antagonist (or more correctly, an inverse histamine agonist) of the alkylamine class. It provides effective, temporary relief of sneezing, watery and itchy eyes, and runny nose due to hay fever and other upper respiratory allergies. Mechanism of action: Brompheniramine works by acting as an antagonist of the H1 histamine receptors. It also functions as a moderately effective anticholingeric agent, likely an antimuscarinic agent similar to other common antihistamines such as diphenhydramine. Its effects on the cholinergic system may include side-effects such as drowsiness, sedation, dry mouth, dry throat, blurred vision, and increased heart rate. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule.
