Each adult has a bilaterally symmetric pair of these neurons, each with a large cell body at the posterior of the protocerebrum and a long primary neurite (GO:0070852) that branches to forms an extensive dendritic tree in the brain and an axon that projects, via the cervical connective, to the mesothorax. Targets of dendritic arborization include zone A of the antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC) (Kamikouchi et al, 2009) and the inferior ventro-lateral protocerebrum. In the mesothorax, the axon forms electrical synapses with tergotrochanteral muscle motor neuron (TTMn) and peripherally synapsing interneurons (PSI)) of the mesothorax that in turn synapse to the motor neurons of the dorso-longitudinal flight muscles."}}
