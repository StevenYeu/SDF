{"Spinal cord":{"Created":"2006-07-15","Synonym":["Medulla spinalis","Spinal marrow"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","Umlscui":"C0037925","SuperCategory":"Organ","Id":"birnlex_1709","Is part of":"Cerebrospinal axis","Abbrev":"SP","Definition":"Part of the central nervous system located in the vertebral canal continuous with and caudal to the brain; demarcated from brain by plane of foramen magnum. It is composed of an inner core of gray matter in which nerve cells predominate, and an outer layer of white matter in which myelinated nerve fibers predominate, and surrounds the central canal. (CUMBO).The caudal topographic division of the cerebrospinal axis. The usual criterion for distinguishing the two divisions in the adult is that the vertebrate brain lies within the skull whereas the spinal cord lies within the spinal (vertebral) column, although this is a difficult problem in practice; see Crosby et al. (1962, pp. 112-120). Definite knowledge of the spinal cord dates to Hippocrates in Fleshes (see translation by Potter, 1995, p. 139), and Galen (c162-c176) used the term specifically-see translation by De Lacy (1978, p. 85)."}}
