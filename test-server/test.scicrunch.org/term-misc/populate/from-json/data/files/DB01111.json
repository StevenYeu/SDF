Colistimethate is particularly indicated when the infection is caused by sensitive strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pharmacology: Colistimethate is a polymyxin antibiotic agent. Originally, colistimethate sodium was thought to be less toxic than polymyxin B; however, if the drugs are administered at comparable doses, their toxicities may be similar. Polymyxins are cationic polypeptides that disrupt the bacterial cell membrane through a detergentlike mechanism. With the development of less toxic agents, such as extended-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins, parenteral polymyxin use was largely abandoned, except for the treatment of multidrug-resistant pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. More recently, however, the emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, and the lack of new antimicrobial agents have led to the revived use of the polymyxins. Mechanism of action: Colistimethate is a surface active agent which penetrates into and disrupts the bacterial cell membrane. Colistimethate is polycationic and has both hydrophobic and lipophilic moieties. It interacts with the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, changing its permeability. This effect is bactericidal. There is also evidence that polymyxins enter the cell and precipitate cytoplasmic components, primarily ribosomes. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antibacterial Agents"}}
