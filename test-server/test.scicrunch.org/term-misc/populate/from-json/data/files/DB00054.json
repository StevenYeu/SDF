Abciximab binds to the glycoprotein (GP) IIb\/IIIa receptor of human platelets and inhibits platelet aggregation. Pharmacology: Used for the treatment of myocardial infarction and the prevention of platelet aggregation. Abciximab inhibits platelet aggregation by preventing the binding of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and other adhesive molecules to GPIIb\/IIIa receptor sites on activated platelets. Mechanism of action: Abciximab binds to the intact platelet GPIIb\/IIIa receptor, which is a member of the integrin family of adhesion receptors and the major platelet surface receptor involved in platelet aggregation. This binding is thought to involve steric hindrance and\/or conformational alterations which block access of large molecules to the receptor rather than direct interaction with the RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) binding site of GPlIb\/IIIa. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Anticoagulants. Antiplatelet Agents"}}
