Pharmacology: Tiludronate is a first generation (non-nitrogenous) bisphosphonate in the same family as etidronate and clodronate. Tiludronate affects calcium metabolism and inhibits bone resorption and soft tissue calcification. Of the tiludronate that is resorbed (from oral preparation) or infused (for intravenous drugs), about 50% is excreted unchanged by the kidney. The remainder has a very high affinity for bone tissue, and is rapidly absorbed onto the bone surface. Mechanism of action: The bisphosphonate group binds strongly to the bone mineral, hydroxyapatite. This explains the specific pharmacological action of these compounds on mineralized tissues, especially bone. In vitro studies indicate that tiludronate acts primarily on bone through a mechanism that involves inhibition of osteoclastic activity with a probable reduction in the enzymatic and transport processes that lead to resorption of the mineralized matrix. Bone resorption occurs following recruitment, activation, and polarization of osteoclasts. Tiludronate appears to inhibit osteoclasts by at least two mechanisms: disruption of the cytoskeletal ring structure, possibly by inhibition of protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, thus leading to detachment of osteoclasts from the bone surface and the inhibition of the osteoclastic proton pump.
