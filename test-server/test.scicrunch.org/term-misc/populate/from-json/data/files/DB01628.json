Current therapeutic indications are: treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, chronic low back pain, acute pain and gout. Like any other COX-2 selective inhibitor, Etoricoxib selectively inhibits isoform 2 of cyclo-oxigenase enzyme (COX-2). This reduces the generation of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid. Pharmacology: Etoricoxib is a COX-2 selective inhibitor (approximately 106 times more selective for COX-2 inhibition over COX-1). Currently it is approved in more than 60 countries worldwide but not in the US, where the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) require additional safety and efficacy data for etoricoxib before it will issue approval. Mechanism of action: Like any other COX-2 selective inhibitor Etoricoxib selectively inhibits isoform 2 of cyclo-oxigenase enzyme (COX-2). This reduces prostaglandins (PGs) generation from arachidonic acid. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}}
