(PubChem) Pharmacology: Lomustine is an alkylating agent of the nitrosourea type. Lomustine and its metabolites interferes with the function of DNA and RNA. It is cell cyclephase nonspecific. Cancers form when some cells within the body multiply uncontrollably and abnormally. These cells then spread and destroy nearby tissues. Lomustine acts by slowing this process down. It kills cancer cells by damaging the DNA (the genetic material inside the cells) and stops them from dividing. Mechanism of action: Lomustine is a highly lipophilic nitrosourea compound which undergoes hydrolysis in vivo to form reactive metabolites. These metabolites cause alkylation and cross-linking of DNA. Other biologic effects include inhibition of DNA synthesis and some cell cycle phase specificity. Nitrosureas generally lack cross-resistance with other alkylating agents. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antineoplastic Agents. Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating"}}
