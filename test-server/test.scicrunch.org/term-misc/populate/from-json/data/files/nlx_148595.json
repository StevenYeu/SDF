The gamma neurons are the first born of the Kenyon cells, born before the alpha' and beta' neurons. In the pedunculus, the gamma axons occupy the periphery, with the alpha \/ beta neurons occupying the core stratum and the alpha' \/ beta' neurons in the intermediate stratum (Awasaki and Ito, 2004, Awasaki et al., 2006, Tanaka et al., 2008). The gamma neuron also arborizes in the calyx, forming pre- and post-synaptic terminals (Christiansen et al., 2011).","hasDBXref":"VFB:FBbt_00100247"}}
