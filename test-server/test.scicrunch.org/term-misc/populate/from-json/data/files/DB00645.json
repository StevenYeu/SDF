It is also found in some varieties of the Cepacol sore throat spray. Pharmacology: Dyclonine is an oral anasthetic. If substantial quantities of local anesthetics are absorbed through the mucosa, actions on the central nervous system (CNS) may cause CNS stimulation and\/or CNS depression. Actions on the cardiovascular system may cause depression of cardiac conduction and excitability and, with some of these agents, peripheral vasodilation. Mechanism of action: Local anesthetics block both the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses by decreasing the neuronal membrane's permeability to sodium ions. This reversibly stabilizes the membrane and inhibits depolarization, resulting in the failure of a propagated action potential and subsequent conduction blockade. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anesthetics, Local. Anesthetics, Mucosal-Local"}}
