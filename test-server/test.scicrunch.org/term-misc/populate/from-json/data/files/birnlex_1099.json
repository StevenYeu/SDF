For invertebrates the longitudinal division consists of one or more nerve cords, whereas for vertebrates it consists of a single, hollow, and dorsal cerebrospinal axis.In adult Echinoderms, which are radially symmetrical, a presumptive CNS is formed by a circular cord with associated radial cords. However, there is no ganglion that could be considered as brain in invertebrate When a CNS is present, its obligate companion topographic division is a peripheral nervous system.The term, as it currently defined, was first used by Meckel (1817)."}}
