{"Temporal Pattern Generation":{"RelatedTo":"Activity pattern","CurationStatus":"uncurated","Comment":["Is this the same as central pattern generator? No"],"SuperCategory":"Electrophysiology concept","Id":"oen_0001029","DefiningCitation":"ModelDB:3633","Definition":"Refers to process where networks of neurons or neural network models exhibit patterns of activity (membrane potential or actional potentials) that vary over time. Single neurons or neuron models may also exhibit temporal patterns of activity such as changes in action potential frequency."}}
