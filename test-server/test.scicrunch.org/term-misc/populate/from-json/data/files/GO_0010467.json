{"Gene expression":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Biological process","Id":"GO_0010467","Definition":"The process by which a gene's coding sequence is converted into a mature gene product or products (proteins or RNA). This includes the production of an RNA transcript as well as any processing to produce a mature RNA product or an mRNA (for protein-coding genes) and the translation of that mRNA into protein. Some protein processing events may be included when they are required to form an active form of a product from an inactive precursor form."}}
