It produces a dose-related inhibition of gastric acid and pepsin secretion, and enhances mucosal resistance to injury. It is an effective anti-ulcer agent and also has oxytocic properties. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) analogue used for the treatment and prevention of stomach ulcers. When administered, misoprostol stimulates increased secretion of the protective mucus that lines the gastrointestinal tract and increases mucosal blood flow, thereby increasing mucosal integrity. It is sometimes co-prescribed with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to prevent the occurrence of gastric ulceration, a common adverse effect of the NSAIDs. Mechanism of action: Misoprostol seems to inhibit gastric acid secretion by a direct action on the parietal cells through binding to the prostaglandin receptor. The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which normally activate adenylate cyclase. The indirect inhibition of adenylate cyclase by Misoprostol may be dependent on guanosine-5-triphosphate (GTP). The significant cytoprotective actions of misoprostol are related to several mechanisms. These include: 1. Increased secretion of bicarbonate, 2. Considerable decrease in the volume and pepsin content of the gastric secretions, 3. It prevents harmful agents from disrupting the tight junctions between the epithelial cells which stops the subsequent back diffusion of H+ ions into the gastric mucosa, 4. Increased thickness of mucus layer, 5. Enhanced mucosal blood flow as a result of direct vasodilatation, 6. Stabilization of tissue lysozymes\/vascular endothelium, and 7. Improvement of mucosal regeneration capacity. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Abortifacient Agents. Abortifacient Agents, Nonsteroidal. Anti-Ulcer Agents. Oxytocics.
