It is nearly as effective orally as by injection. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Levorphanol is a potent synthetic opioid analgesic indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain or as a preoperative medication where an opioid analgesic is appropriate. Levorphanol is similar to morphine in its actions, however it is up to 8 times more potent than morphine. Levorphanol produces a degree of respiratory depression similar to that produced by morphine at equianalgesic doses, and like many mu-opioid drugs, levorphanol produces euphoria or has a positive effect on mood in many individuals. Mechanism of action: Like other mu-agonist opioids it is believed to act at receptors in the periventricular and periaqueductal gray matter in both the brain and spinal cord to alter the transmission and perception of pain. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Analgesics, Opioid. Narcotics"}}
