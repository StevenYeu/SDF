{"Cell biology":{"Synonym":"Cytology","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Biology","Id":"nlx_inv_100617","Definition":"Branch of biology concerned with the study of cells and cellular processes.(formerly cytology, from the Greek kytos, \"container\") is an academic discipline that studies cells \u2013 their physiological properties, their structure, the organelles they contain, interactions with their environment, their life cycle, division and death. This is done both on a microscopic and molecular level. Cell biology research encompasses both the great diversity of single-celled organisms like bacteria and protozoa, as well as the many specialized cells in multicellular organisms like humans.Knowing the components of cells and how cells work is fundamental to all biological sciences. Appreciating the similarities and differences between cell types is particularly important to the fields of cell and molecular biology as well as to biomedical fields such as cancer research and developmental biology. These fundamental similarities and differences provide a unifying theme, sometimes allowing the principles learned from studying one cell type to be extrapolated and generalized to other cell types. Hence, research in cell biology is closely related to genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology and developmental biology. - definition adapted from Wikipedia"}}
