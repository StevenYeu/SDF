It also inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Meclofenamic acid is a nonsteroidal agent which has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activity in laboratory animals. Mechanism of action: The mode of action, like that of other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, is not known. Therapeutic action does not result from pituitary-adrenal stimulation. In animal studies, meclofenamic acid was found to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and to compete for binding at the prostaglandin receptor site. In vitro meclofenamic acid was found to be an inhibitor of human leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase activity. These properties may be responsible for the anti-inflammatory action of meclofenamic acid. There is no evidence that meclofenamic acid alters the course of the underlying disease. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal. Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}}
