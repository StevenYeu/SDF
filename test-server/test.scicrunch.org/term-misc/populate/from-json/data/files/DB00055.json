Drotrecogin alfa (activated) is a glycoprotein of approximately 55 kilodalton molecular weight, consisting of a heavy chain and a light chain linked by a disulfide bond. Pharmacology: Activated Protein C exerts an antithrombotic effect by inhibiting (cleaving) Factors Va and VIIIa. In vitro data indicate that Activated Protein C has indirect profibrinolytic activity through its ability to inhibit plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and limiting generation of activated thrombin-activatable-fibrinolysis-inhibitor. The net effect is the reduction or elimination of blood clots Mechanism of action: Activated protein C combines with protein S on platelet surfaces and then degrades factor Va and factor VIIIa. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Antisepsis Agents"}}
