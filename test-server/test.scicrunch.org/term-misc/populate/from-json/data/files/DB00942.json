Pharmacology: Cycrimine is a central anticholenergic used in the treatment of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It is a drug used to reduce levels of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is usually in balance with dopamine neurotransmitters, however lower levels of dopamine are present in the brain of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. By lowering levels of acetylcholine, it is thought that this balance may be restored. Mechanism of action: Cycrimine binds the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1, effectively inhibiting acetylcholine. This decrease in acetylcholine restores the normal dopamine-acetylcholine balance and relieves the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antidyskinetics. Antiparkinson Agents"}}
