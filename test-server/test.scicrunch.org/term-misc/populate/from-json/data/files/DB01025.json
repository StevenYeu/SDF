Amlexanox as a topical paste is a well tolerated treatment of recurrent aphthous ulcers. Recurrent aphthous ulcer (RAU) is the most prevalent oral mucosal disease in humans, estimated to affect between 5% and 50% of the general population. Pharmacology: Amlexanox is a mucoadhesive oral paste which has been clinically proven to abort the onset, accelerate healing and resolve the pain of aphthous ulcers (canker sores). It decreases the time ulcers take to heal. Because amlexanox decreases the healing time, it also decreases the pain you feel. Recent studies have also shown that the majority of ulcers can be prevented by application of the paste during the prodromal (pre-ulcerative) phase of the disease. Recurrent Aphthous Ulcers (RAU) also known as Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis (RAS) is recognized as the most common oral mucosal disease known to man. Estimates suggest that 20% - 25% of the general population suffer at least one incidence of aphthous ulcers each year. Mechanism of action: As a benzopyrano-bipyridine carboxylic acid derivative, amlexanox has anti-inflammatory and antiallergic properties. It inhibits chemical mediatory release of the slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) and may have antagonistic effects on interleukin-3. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Allergic Agents. Anti-inflammatory, Locally Applied. Antiulcer agent (topical)"}}
