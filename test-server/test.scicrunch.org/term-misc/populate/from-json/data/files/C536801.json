This gene plays a pivotal role in development of the human nervous system, including the brain, and loss of this genetic component prevents proper nervous system construction during fetal development.There is a wide range of severity of symptoms observed in people with the deletion, but most exhibit moderate to severe developmental delays, physically and intellectually, but especially in speaking and communicating. Very low muscle tone is a common trait of the syndrome, and many have problems with eating, sleeping and emotional stability. - Def source - Phelan-McDermid Syndrome Foundation"}}
