{"Microelectrode array assay":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Micro-electrode recording assay","Id":"nlx_49488","Has role":"Electrophysiology concept","Abbrev":"MEA","Definition":"An assay that uses a microelectrode device.  A microelecrtode device contain multiple plates or shanks through which neural signals are obtained or delivered, essentially serving as neural interfaces that connect neurons to electronic circuitry. There are two general classes of MEAs: implantable MEAs, used in vivo, and non-implantable MEAs, used in vitro (adapted from Wikipedia http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Multielectrode_array)."}}
