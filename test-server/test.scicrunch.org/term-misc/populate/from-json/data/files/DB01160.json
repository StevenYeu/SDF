Dinoprost tromethamine may also be known as dinoprost trometamol, PGF2 alpha THAM, or prostaglandin F2 alpha tromethamine. Pharmacology: Dinoprost tromethamine is the tromethamine (THAM) salt of the naturally occurring prostaglandin F2alpha. Prostaglandin F2alphahas several pharmacologic effects on the female reproductive system, including stimulation of myometrial activity, relaxation of the cervix, inhibition of steroidogenesis by corpora lutea, and can potentially lyse corpora lutea. Mechanism of action: Dinoprost tromethamine appears to act directly on the myometrium, but this has not been completely established. Dinoprost stimulates myometrial contractions in the gravid uterus that are similar to the contractions that occur in the term uterus during labor. These contractions are usually sufficient to cause abortion. Uterine response to prostaglandins increases gradually throughout pregnancy. Dinoprost also facilitates cervical dilatation and softening. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Abortifacient Agents, Nonsteroidal. Diagnostic aid (angiography). Oxytocics. Uterine stimulants"}}
