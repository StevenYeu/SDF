Eculizumab contains human constant regions from human IgG2 sequences and human IgG4 sequences and murine complementarity-determining regions grafted onto the human framework light- and heavy-chain variable regions. Eculizumab is composed of two 448 amino acid heavy chains and two 214 amino acid light chains and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kDa. Pharmacology: Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the complement protein C5. This antibody blocks the cleavage of C5 and halts the process of complement-mediated cell destruction. Eculizumab is a product of Alexion Pharmaceuticals and has been shown to be effective in treating paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Eculizumab was approved by the FDA in March, 2007. Mechanism of action: Eculizumab, the active ingredient in Soliris, is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the complement protein C5 with high affinity, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and preventing the generation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9. Soliris inhibits terminal complement mediated intravascular hemolysis in PNH patients. A genetic mutation in PNH patients leads to the generation of populations of abnormal RBCs (known as PNH cells) that are deficient in terminal complement inhibitors, rendering PNH RBCs sensitive to persistent terminal complement-mediated destruction. The destruction and loss of these PNH cells (intravascular hemolysis) results in low RBC counts (anemia), and also fatigue, difficulty in functioning, pain, dark urine, shortness of breath, and blood clots.
