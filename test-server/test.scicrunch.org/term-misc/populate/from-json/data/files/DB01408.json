{"Bambuterol":{"RelatedTo":"Beta-2 adrenergic receptor","Synonym":["Bambuterol hydrochloride","Bambec"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB01408","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB01408","Definition":"Bambuterol is a long acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist used in the treatment of asthma. It is a prodrug of terbutaline. Pharmacology: Bambuterol is a long acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonist used in the treatment of asthma. It is a prodrug of terbutaline. Mechanism of action: The pharmacologic effects of bambuterol are at least in part attributable to stimulation through beta-adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Adrenergic beta-Agonists. Bronchodilator Agents. Sympathomimetics. Tocolytic Agents"}}
