{"Shape":{"SuperCategory":"Morphology","Id":"PATO_0000052","Definition":"A morphological quality inhering in a bearer by virtue of the ratios of distances between its features (points, edges, surfaces and also holes, etc).  Shapes are invariant on size transformations.  Shapes can be subdivided into 2D and 3D shapes.  We can also make a distinction between shapes of complete self-connected objects, and shapes of parts of objects."}}
