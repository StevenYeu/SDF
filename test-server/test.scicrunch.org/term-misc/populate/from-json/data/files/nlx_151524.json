{"Hypothalamus of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["hypothalamus p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151524","Is part of":"Forebrain of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"The hypothalamus can be segmented in coronal T2-weighted or diffusion-weighted images (DWI). The rostral border between the hippocampus and preoptic area is not well defined in these images. Our solution is to create an arbitrary plane dividing the two just caudal to the optic chiasm, or at roughly the level of the vertical descent of the fornix in to the hypothalamus. On T2 MRI the lateral border with the brighter amygdala and darker horizontal limbs of the diagonal band is relatively well defined. Caudally, the much darker optic tracts define the lateral border as they course between the amygdala and hypothalamus. The dorsal border with the diencephalon can be identified based on the dark speckled appearance of the ventral zona incerta. The caudal amygdala becomes triangular in shape just dorsal to the pituitary comprised of the mammillary bodies and supramammillary nuclei. At its caudal extent the egg-shaped medial mamillary nucleus becomes a free-floating structure just ventral to the dark fasciculus retroflexus and dorsal to the anterior pituitary."}}
