{"Pineal Gland of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["pineal p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151525","Is part of":"Forebrain of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"The pineal gland shares the same developmental origin as the diencephalon, but it is spatially distinct and can be very rapidly segmented on virtually any MRI contrast. The gland sits just dorsal to the superior colliculi and is free floating in most coronal slices. The simplest way to segment this structure is with a seeded threshold (magic wand) tool or a propagating wave (blow) tool."}}
