(PubChem) Pharmacology: Meclizine, a piperazine-derivative H1-receptor antagonist similar to buclizine, cyclizine, and hydroxyzine, is used as an antivertigo\/antiemetic agent. Meclizine is used in the management of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness and vertigo in diseases affecting the vestibular apparatus. Mechanism of action: Along with its actions as an antagonist at H1-receptors, meclizine also possesses anticholinergic, central nervous system depressant, and local anesthetic effects. Meclizine depresses labyrinth excitability and vestibular stimulation and may affect the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Allergic Agents. Antiemetics. Antihistamines. Histamine H1 Antagonists"}}
