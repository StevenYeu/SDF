Each sensillum contains a pair of sensory dendrites. The outer segment of these dendrites is encased in an electron-dense dendritic sheath and each of the pair has a distinct morphology: one is short and cylindrical proximally, but flattened distally, the other is larger and has a plasma membrane that form 2 interdigitating spiral whorls of lamellae and has periodically arranged electron dense particles protruding from the plasma membrane into the extracellular space (Foelix et al., 1989). The inner-segments of these dendrites are delimited from the outer segments by a ciliary region and are rich in vesicles, mitochondria and ribosomes. The somata sit in a small ganglion near the base of the arista. The axons project via the aristal nerve, which merges with the antennal nerve, and innervate glomeruli VP2 and \/ or VP3 of the adult antennal lobe. (Stocker et al., 1983)."}}
