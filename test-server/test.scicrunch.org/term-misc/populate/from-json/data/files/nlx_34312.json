I am wondering whether motor reflex is a synonym for H-reflex.  Wikipedia","however"],"SuperCategory":"Reflex","Id":"nlx_34312","Definition":"A motor reflex consisting of a reflectory reaction of muscles after electrical stimulation of sensory fibers (Ia afferents stemming from muscle spindles) in their innervating nerves (for example, those located behind the knee). The H-reflex test is performed using an electric stimulator, which gives usually a square-wave current of short duration and small amplitude (higher stimulations might involve alpha fibers, causing a M-wave, compromising the results), and an EMG set, to record the muscle response. That response is usually a clear wave, called H-wave, 50 ms after the stimulus, not to be confused with M-wave at 25-30 ms, which might appear in too intense stimulations. (adapted from Wikipedia)"}}
