Unlike neurons in areas 17, 18, and 19 (V1, V2, V3), cells in this region \"are relatively insensitive to form and position but have specific requirements of direction of movement.\"  This region was later referred to as the middle temporal area (MT) after the presumed homologous region in owl monkeys.  Zeki later termed it V5 (the fifth cortical visual area)."}}
