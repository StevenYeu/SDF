{"Pallidum of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["pallidum p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151536","Is part of":"Subpallium of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"The pallidum is fairly easy to segment on coronal diffusion-weighted images (DWI). The entire medial border of the globus pallidus is defined by the internal capsule, which appears as a dark (high diffusivity) vertical band. The entire lateral border is with the caudate\/putamen. This border is somewhat more subtle and may be indistinguishable on T2 MRI. On DWI, the pallidum is somewhat darker (higher diffusivity) than the caudate\/putamen and is more densely striated. By narrowing the contrast window, this difference can be accentuated enough to make the border apparent. The ventral pallidum is also quite easy to segment on DWI. It appears as a dark horizontal band just ventral to the pale, circular accumbens nucleus and dorsal to the very bright olfactory tubercle. Caudal to the posterior limbs of the anterior commissure, the ventral pallidum moves dorsal and merges with the globus pallidus."}}
