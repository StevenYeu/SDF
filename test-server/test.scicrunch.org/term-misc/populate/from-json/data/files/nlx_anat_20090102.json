{"Clarke's Nucleus":{"PMID":"4173077","EditorialNote":"This class was originally entered as a plural (Clarke's nuclei) and so was entered as a duplicate class as a singular (nlx_12).  However, as ontology classes should be singular and as the singular is the more common form, I am going to merge the two classes, retain the original identifier but make the singular the preferred name.","Synonym":["nucleus dorsalis"],"CurationStatus":"graph position temporary","SuperCategory":"Regional part of spinal cord","Curator":"Maryann Martone,","Id":"nlx_anat_20090102","Is part of":["Lumbar spinal cord dorsal horn"],"DefiningCitation":"Boehme CC. 1968.
