(PubChem) Pharmacology: Delavirdine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nNRTI) with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Delavirdine binds directly to reverse transcriptase (RT) and blocks the RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities by causing a disruption of the enzyme's catalytic site. The activity of Delavirdine does not compete with template or nucleoside triphosphates. HIV-2 RT and eukaryotic DNA polymerases (such as human DNA polymerases alpha, beta, or sigma) are not inhibited by Delavirdine. Mechanism of action: Delavirdine binds directly to viral reverse transcriptase (RT) and blocks the RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities by disrupting the enzyme's catalytic site. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-HIV Agents. Nonnucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors. Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors"}}
