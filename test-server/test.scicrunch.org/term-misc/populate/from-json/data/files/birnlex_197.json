{"C57BL":{"Created":"2006-10-05","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Inbred mouse strain","Id":"birnlex_197","Abbrev":"B","Definition":"Jax black subline derived from Little (1921) line which derived from original Lathrop stock (Beck, J.A., et al., Geneology of mouse inbred strains (2000), Nature, Jan2000, v24, p23).  A strain of laboratory mouse. It is probably the most widely used of all inbred strains, (substrain C57BL\/6 alone accounts for over 14% of occasions on which an inbred strain is used) though in many ways it seems to be atypical of inbred strains of laboratory mice. In contrast to 36 other standard inbred strains, it carries a Y chromosome of Asian Mus musculus origin (c.f. AKR and SWR) (Tucker et al 1992), and a LINE-1 element derived from Mus spretus the frequency of which suggests that up to 6.5% of the genome may be of M. spretus origin (Rikke et al, 1995). The phenotypic and genotypic similarity between any two related strains depends on the extent to which the parental colony was inbred at the time the strains were separated, and whether other strains contributed to the parentage of either strain. For example, C57BL\/6 and C57BL\/10 were separated in 1921, at a time when the parental C57BL colony was substantially inbred, and no other strains are known to have contributed to the parentage of either strain.
