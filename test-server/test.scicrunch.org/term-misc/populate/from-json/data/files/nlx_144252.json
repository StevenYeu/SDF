These neurons proliferate from from the subventricular zone, migrate through the rostral migratory stream and integrate into the olfactory bulb granule cell layer.  Upon arriving in the olfactory bulb granule cell layer they migrate radially outward and mature with morphologies similar to neonate olfactory bulb granule cells.  This process continues throughout the adult life of the vertibrate.  There is some decline in adult neurogenesis in aged vertebrates and the presence of the subventricular proliferative zone is controversial in humans","DefinitionPMID":"5361244"}}
