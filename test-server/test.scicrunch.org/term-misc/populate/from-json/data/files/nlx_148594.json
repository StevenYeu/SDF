The cell body fiber runs posteriorly and bifurcates laterally and medially. The lateral branch arborizes in the lateral-most spur area of the gamma lobe and the inner core of the pedunculus. The medial branch bifurcates in front of the middle segment of the medial lobe. One of the branches projects to the contralateral medial lobe. On the way to the opposite hemisphere, in the medial segment of the medial lobe, one fiber branches out, turns dorsolaterally and arborizes in the inferior neuropils. Some fibers extend further to the superior neuropils. The other branch turns dorsally, runs along the alpha lobe and terminates in the posterior tip of the alpha' lobe.","hasDBXref":"FlyBrain_NDB:10471"}}
