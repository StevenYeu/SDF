The cell body fiber bifurcates in front of the vertical lobes. One of these branches turns ventromedially to the tip of the medial lobe, whereas the other runs dorsally. The first branch innervates the medial lobe through the border between the gamma and beta' lobes and bifurcates both medially and laterally at the border between the beta and beta' lobes. One bundle of fibers runs medially to the opposite lobe, whereas the other runs laterally to the basal segments of the beta and alpha lobe as well as the core of the pedunculus. The second of the initial branches diverges in the superior neuropils near the tip of the vertical lobe. One branch turns laterally, runs through the anterior side of the vertical lobe and terminates in the superior intermediate protocerebrum and superior medial protocerebrum. Another branch turns medially and terminates in the anterior dorsal superior medial protocerebrum. Some branches turn laterally, innervating the posterior dorsal superior medial protocerebrum and posterior dorsal superior lateral protocerebrum, and terminate in the anterior dorsal superior lateral protocerebrum.","hasDBXref":"FlyBrain_NDB:10470"}}
