It has been used therapeutically as an antidepressant, antipsychotic, and as a digestive aid. (From Merck Index, 11th ed) Pharmacology: Sulpiride is a substituted benzamide derivative and a selective dopamine D2 antagonist with antipsychotic and antidepressant activity. Other benzamide derivatives include metoclopramide, tiapride, and sultopride. Mechanism of action: In contrast to most other neuroleptics which block both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, Sulpiride is more selective and acts primarily as a dopamine D2 antagonist. Sulpiride appears to lack effects on norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, histamine, or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antidepressants. Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation. Antipsychotic Agents. Antipsychotics. Dopamine Antagonists"}}
