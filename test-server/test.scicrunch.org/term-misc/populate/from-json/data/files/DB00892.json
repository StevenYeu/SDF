Oxybuprocaine binds to sodium channels and reversibly stabilizes the neuronal membrane which decreases its permeability to sodium ions. Pharmacology: Oxybuprocaine is a local anaesthetic. It may be less irritating than tetracaine, and the onset and duration of action are similar to tetracaine. Mechanism of action: Oxybuprocaine binds to sodium channel and reversibly stabilizes the neuronal membrane which decreases its permeability to sodium ions. Depolarization of the neuronal membrane is inhibited thereby blocking the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anesthetics, Local"}}
