(From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1251) Pharmacology: Oxymetazoline a adrenergic alpha-agonists, direct acting sympathomimetic used as a vasoconstrictor to relieve nasal congestion The sympathomimetic action of oxymetazoline constricts the smaller arterioles of the nasal passages, producing a prolonged (up to 12 hours), gentle and decongesting effect. Oxymetazoline elicits relief of conjunctival hyperemia by causing vasoconstriction of superficial conjunctival blood vessels. The drug's action has been demonstrated in acute allergic conjunctivitis and in chemical (chloride) conjunctivitis. Mechanism of action: Oxymetazoline is a direct acting sympathomimetic amine, which acts on alpha-adrenergic receptors in the arterioles of the conjunctiva and nasal mucosa. It produces vasoconstriction, resulting in decreased conjunctival congestion in ophthalmic. In nasal it produces constriction, resulting in decreased blood flow and decreased nasal congestion. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Adrenergic alpha-Agonists. Nasal Decongestants. Sympathomimetics"}}
