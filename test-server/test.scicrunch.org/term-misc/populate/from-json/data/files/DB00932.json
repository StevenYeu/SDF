It is administered with ritonavir in combination therapy to treat HIV infections. Pharmacology: Tipranavir is a non-peptidic protease inhibitor (PI) of HIV. Protease inhibitors block the part of HIV called protease. HIV-1 protease is an enzyme required for the proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors into the individual functional proteins found in infectious HIV-1. Nelfinavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. Protease inhibitors are almost always used in combination with at least two other anti-HIV drugs. Mechanism of action: Tipranavir (TPV) is a non-peptidic HIV-1 protease inhibitor that inhibits the virus-specific processing of the viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins in HIV-1 infected cells, thus preventing formation of mature virions. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-HIV Agents. HIV Protease Inhibitors"}}
