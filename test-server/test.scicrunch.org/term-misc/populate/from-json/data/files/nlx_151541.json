{"Pituitary of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["pituitary p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151541","Is part of":"Developmentally Diverse Structures of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"The majority of the pituitary is seen free-floating in coronal slices (i.e. not directly connected to other brain regions) making it easy to segment in skull stripped images. The pituitary sits just ventral to the mammillary bodies. The simplest way to segment this structure is with a seeded threshold (magic wand) tool or a propagating wave (blow) tool."}}
