{"Dorsal intermediate entorhinal area of RHA11":{"CytoDefiningCriteria":["Layer I is rather narrow and contains very few scattered neurons. Layer II contains rather big","rounded neurons that are distinctly stained in regular Nissl stain. A very narrow","relatively acellular band separates layer II from layer III in much of the DIE. Layer III is wide","and clearly presents a narrow","more densely packed outer zone with its neurons arranged in cell clusters","and a less densely and irregularly packed inner zone.Layer V is rather narrow and comprises loosely arranged medium- or big-sized pyramids that are not as darkly stained as those in the ventral-intermediate entorhinal area (VIE) and the medial entorhinal area (ME). This difference is particularly striking in layer Va of these areas. Whereas layer Va is a more or less continuous row of large","darkly stained neurons in ME and to a slightly lesser extent in VIE","such cells are only incidentally present in DIE.Layer VI is narrow","lacks a columnar arrangement"],"AtlasImage":"Entorhinal cortex DIE of RHA11.jpg,","DefiningCriteria":"cyto-architecture","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"RHA11 hippocampal parcellation scheme region","PublicationLink":"http:\/\/cmbn-approd01.uio.no\/zoomgen\/hippocampus\/Structures\/DorsalIntermediateEntorhinalArea.do","Id":"nlx_152002","ParcellationScheme":"RHA11 hippocampal parcellation scheme","Is part of":"Entorhinal cortex of RHA11","ParcellationSchemePMID":"21519393","Species":"Long Evans Rat,","Abbrev":"DIE","Definition":"Ventrolateral portion of the entorhinal cortex"}}
