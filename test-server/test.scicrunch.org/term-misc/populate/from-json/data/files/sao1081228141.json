{"Glycogen Granule":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Cellular component","Id":"sao1081228141","Definition":"Cytoplasmic bead-like structures of animal cells, visible by electron microscope. Each granule is a functional unit with the biosynthesis and catabolism of glycogen being catalyzed by enzymes bound to the granule surface (Gene Ontology).  Appears as small, electron dense particles 20-40 nm in diameter.  Glycogen is difficult to fix in vivo so amounts may be underestimated (Peters, Palay and Webster)."}}
