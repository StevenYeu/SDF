At the area 17\/18 border, callosal neurons are distributed evenly throughout the depth of layer 5.  These neurons do not send projections to either the pontine nuclei or the superior colliculus.  Apical dendrites of these cells were never observed to extend above layer 4.  Basal dendrites were restricted to layer 5 and upper part of layer 6.  2-6 primary basal dendrites originated from the base of the pyramid or ovoid cell body.","DefinitionPMID":"3385021"}}
