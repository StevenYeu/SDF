(PubChem) Pharmacology: Penicillin V is a penicillin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. The name \"penicillin\" can either refer to several variants of penicillin available, or to the group of antibiotics derived from the penicillins. Penicillin V has in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of Penicillin V results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through Penicillin V binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Penicillin V is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases. Mechanism of action: By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, Penicillin V inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that Penicillin V interferes with an autolysin inhibitor. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents. Penicillins"}}
