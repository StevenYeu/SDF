Its actions and uses are similar to those of warfarin. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p233) Pharmacology: Acenocoumarol is a coumarin that is used as an anticoagulant. Its actions and uses are similar to those of warfarin. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p233) Mechanism of action: Acenocoumarol inhibits vitamin K reductase, resulting in depletion of the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin KH2). As vitamin K is a cofactor for the carboxylation of glutamate residues on the N-terminal regions of vitamin K-dependent proteins, this limits the gamma-carboxylation and subsequent activation of the vitamin K-dependent coagulant proteins. The synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S is inhibited. Depression of three of the four vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (factors II, VII, and X) results in decresed prothrombin levels and a decrease in the amount of thrombin generated and bound to fibrin. This reduces the thrombogenicity of clots. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anticoagulants. Coumarin and Indandione Derivatives"}}
