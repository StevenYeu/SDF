{"Discontinuous single cell voltage clamp":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Electrical recording protocol","Id":"oen_0001178","Has role":"Electrophysiology concept","Definition":"An experimental protocol that prevents the opening and closing of voltage-gated channels and removes their influence on the membrane potential.  A direct measure of membrane current can be obtained with this technique by recording the current that must be generated by the voltage clamp to keep the membrane potential from changing. "}}
