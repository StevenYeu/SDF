Ibritumomab is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells and is composed of two murine gamma 1 heavy chains of 445 amino acids each and two kappa light chains of 213 amino acids each. Pharmacology: Zevalin binds to the CD20 antigen, which is predominantly expressed on mature B cells and on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lympohomas. The antibody leads to selective killing of B-cells. Mechanism of action: Binds to the CD20 antigen which is found on mature B lymphocytes. The Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis. The antibody appears to induce apoptosis, antibody mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. The chelate tiuxetan, which tightly binds radioactive In-111 or Y-90, is covalently linked to the amino groups of exposed lysines and arginines contained within the antibody. The beta emission from Y-90 induces cellular damage by the formation of free radicals in the target and neighboring cells. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Antineoplastic Agents"}}
