{"Spectrin":{"SuperCategory":"Cytoskeletal Protein","Id":"sao536287099","Definition":"Membrane associated dimeric protein (240 and 220 kDa) of erythrocytes. Forms a complex with ankyrin, actin and probably other components of the membrane cytoskeleton, so that there is a mesh of proteins underlying the plasma membrane, potentially restricting the lateral mobility of integral proteins (Gene Ontology)."}}
