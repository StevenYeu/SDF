The term has come to be identified with the clusters of granule cells found in the olfactory tubercle but the original paper may have been pointing to the dense cell layer. He recommended that it be dropped (Millhouse, J Comp Neurol., 265: 1-24, 1987).Meyer et al. prefer that only those aggregates within the olfactory tubercle be called Islands of Calleja and that the term \"clusters of granule cells\" be adopted elsewhere.  However, others use Islands of Calleja to refer to all granule cell clusters.","NeuronamesID":"258","Umlscui":"C0262264","PublicationDate":"1989","SuperCategory":"Regional part of brain","PublicationName":"Journal of Comparative Neurology","Id":"birnlex_1113","JournalNumber":"3","Is part of":["Telencephalon"],"Species":"Mammal","Definition":"Small clusters of granule cells located in the olfactory tubercle and also within the Island of Calleja magna that lies between the septum and the nucleus accumbens"}}
