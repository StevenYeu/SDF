(PubChem) Pharmacology: Ifosfamide selectively inhibits the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The guanine and cytosine content correlates with the degree of ifosfamide-induced cross-linking. At high concentrations of the drug, cellular RNA and protein synthesis are also suppressed. Mechanism of action: After metabolic activation, active metabolites of ifosfamide alkylate or bind with many intracellular molecular structures, including nucleic acids. The cytotoxic action is primarily due to cross-linking of strands of DNA and RNA, as well as inhibition of protein synthesis. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antineoplastic Agents. Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating. Immunosuppressive Agents"}}
