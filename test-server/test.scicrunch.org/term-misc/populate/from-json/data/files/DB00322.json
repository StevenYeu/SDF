It has been used to treat hepatic metastases of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and for palliation in malignant neoplasms of the liver and gastrointestinal tract. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Floxuridine is a pyrimidine analog that acts as an inhibitor of the S-phase of cell division. This selectively kills rapidly dividing cells. Floxuridine is an anti-metabolite. Anti-metabolites masquerade as pyramidine-like molecules which prevents normal pyrimidines from being incorporated into DNA during the S phase of the cell cycle. Flurouracil (the end-product of catabolism of floxuridine) blacks an enzyme which converts cytosine nucleosides into the deoxy derivative. In addition, DNA synthesis is further inhibited because fluoruracil blocks the incorporation of the thymdine nucleotide into the DNA strand. Mechanism of action: Floxuridine is rapidly catabolized to 5-fluorouracil which is the active form of the drug. Fluorouracil inhibits thymydilate synthase leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis and cell death. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antimetabolites.
