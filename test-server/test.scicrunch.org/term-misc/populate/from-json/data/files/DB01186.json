It has also been observed to have antihypertensive effects. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Pergolide is an ergot derivative dopamine receptor agonist at both D1 and D2 receptor sites. Pergolide is 10 to 1,000 times more potent than bromocriptine on a milligram per milligram basis in various in vitro and in vivo test systems. Pergolide mesylate inhibits the secretion of prolactin in humans; it causes a transient rise in serum concentrations of growth hormone and a decrease in serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone. In Parkinsons disease, pergolide mesylate is believed to exert its therapeutic effect by directly stimulating postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the nigrostriatal system. Mechanism of action: Pergolide is a potent dopamine receptor agonist. It directly stimulates post-synaptic dopamine receptors at both D1 and D2 receptor sites in the nigrostriatal system. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antidyskinetics. Antiparkinson Agents. Central Nervous System Agents. Dopamine Agonists. Neuroprotective Agents"}}
