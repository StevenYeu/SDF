{"Huntingtin":{"SuperCategory":"Protein","Id":"nlx_mol_20090302","Abbrev":"Htt","Definition":"is the protein coded by the gene, huntingtin, identified in 1993. It is variable in its structure as there are many polymorphisms of the gene which can lead to variable numbers of glutamine residues present in the protein. In its wild-type form, it contains 6-35 glutamine residues; however, in individuals affected by Huntington's Disease, it contains more than 36 glutamine residues. Huntingtin has a predicted mass of ~350kDa, although  this varies and is largely dependent on the number of glutamine residues in the protein. Normal huntingtin is generally accepted to be 3144 amino acids in size.  Adapted from Wikipedia"}}
