It acts on the HIV aspartyl protease which the virus needs to cleave the HIV polyprotein into its functional fragments. Pharmacology: Darunavir is an inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease.  In studies, the drug, co-administered with ritonavir in combination therapy, significantly reduced viral load and increased CD4 cell counts in this treatment-experienced patient population (Tibotec, 2006, Product Monograph, Prezista 2006). Darunavir is used as an adjunct therapy with low dose ritonavir, which inhibits cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) which increases the bioavailability and half life of darunavir. Mechanism of action: Darunavir is a HIV protease inhibitor which prevents HIV replication by cleaving HIV encoded Gag-Pol polyproteins in infected cells, reducing viral maturation, load and increasing CD4 T lymphocytes. HIV destroys CD4 T lymphocytes which are an integral part of the immune system. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antiviral Agents. HIV Protease Inhibitors"}}
