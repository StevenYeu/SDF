The name was chosen via EyeWire, a neural mapping 'game', to any player who completed over 100 cubes. Prior to the competition, the specific neuron was known as the 'n00b neuron' by EyeWirers. However, the name was soon officially dubbed as the 'Zoidberg Neuron' during YouTube Geek Week. The name 'Zoidberg' is a reference to the Futurama character, Zoidberg."}}
