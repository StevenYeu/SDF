Grepafloxacin was withdrawn in the United States due to its side effect of lengthening the QT interval on the electrocardiogram, leading to cardiac events and sudden death. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Grepafloxacin has in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic microorganisms, as well as some atypical microorganisms. Mechanism of action: Grepafloxacin exerts its antibacterial activity by inhibiting bacterial topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, essential enzymes for duplication, transcription, and repair of bacterial DNA.
