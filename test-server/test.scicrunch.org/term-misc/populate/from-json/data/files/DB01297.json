(PubChem) Pharmacology: Practolol is a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist that has been used in the emergency treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Mechanism of action: Like other beta-adrenergic antagonists, practolol competes with adrenergic neurotransmitters such as catecholamines for binding at sympathetic receptor sites. Like propranolol and timolol, practolol binds at beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle, inhibiting the effects of the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine and decreasing heart rate, cardiac output, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Adrenergic beta-Antagonists. Anti-Arrhythmia Agents"}}
