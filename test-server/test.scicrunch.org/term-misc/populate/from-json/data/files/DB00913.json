It is a narcotic pain reliever used to treat moderate to severe pain. Narcotic analgesics act in the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain. Some of their side effects are also caused by actions in the CNS. Pharmacology: Anileridine, a potent analgesic, is an analog of pethidine. Anileridine is useful for the relief of moderate to severe pain. It may also be used as an analgesic adjunct in general anesthesia in the same manner as meperidine to reduce the amount of anesthetic needed, to facilitate relaxation, and to reduce laryngospasm. In addition, anileridine exerts mild antihistaminic, spasmolytic and antitussive effects. Anileridine's main pharmacologic action is exerted on the CNS. Respiratory depression, when it occurs, is of shorter duration than that seen with morphine or meperidine when equipotent analgesic doses are used. Mechanism of action: Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Opioids such as anileridine close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist). This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability. Drug type: Approved. Illicit. Small Molecule. Drug category: Analgesics. Narcotics. Opiate Agonists"}}
