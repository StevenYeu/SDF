{"Cinoxacin":{"RelatedTo":"DNA","SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB00827","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB00827","Definition":"Synthetic antimicrobial related to oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid and used in urinary tract infections. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Cinoxacin is a synthetic antibacterial agent with in vitro activity against many gram-negative aerobic bacteria, particularly strains of the Enterobacteriaceae family. Cinoxacin inhibits bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis, is bactericidal, and is active over the entire urinary pH range. Cross resistance with nalidixic acid has been demonstrated. Mechanism of action: Evidence exists that cinoxacin binds strongly, but reversibly, to DNA, interfering with synthesis of RNA and, consequently, with protein synthesis. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Infective Agents"}}
