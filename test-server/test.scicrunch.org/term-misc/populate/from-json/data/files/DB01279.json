{"Galsulfase":{"RelatedTo":"Mannose-6-phosphate receptor-binding protein 1","Synonym":["galsulfase","Naglazyme"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB01279","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB01279","Definition":"Galsufase is a variant form of the polymorphic human enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase of recombinant DNA origin. Galsulfase is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 56 kD. The recombinant protein is comprised of 495 amino acids and contains six asparagine-linked glycosylation sites, four of which carry a bis mannose-6-phosphate manose7 oligosaccharide for specific cellular recognition. Post-translational modification of Cys53 produces the catalytic amino acid residue Ca-formylglycine, which is required for enzyme activity and is conserved in all members of the sulfatase enzyme family. Pharmacology: Mucopolysaccharide storage disorders are caused by the deficiency of specific lysosomal enzymes required for the catabolism of GAG. Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI, Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome) is characterized by the absence or marked reduction in N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase. The sulfatase activity deficiency results in the accumulation of the GAG substrate dermatan sulfate, throughout the body. This accumulation leads to widespread cellular, tissue, and organ dysfunction. Galsulfase is intended to provide an exogenous enzyme that will be taken up into lysosomes and increase the catabolism of GAG. Galsulfase uptake by cells into lysosomes is most likely mediated by the binding of mannose-6-phosphate-terminated oligosaccharide chains of galsulfase to specific mannose-6-phosphate receptors. Mechanism of action: Galsulfase supplies recombinant-engineered galsulfase, a normal variant form of the polymorphic human enzyme, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase. It is a lysosomal hydrolase that catalyzes the cleavage of the sulfate ester from terminal N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate residues of GAG chondroitin 4-sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Increased catabolism of GAG in turn reduces systemic dermatan sulfate accumulation, thereby reducing the primary symptoms of MPS VI. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational.
