{"Cerebellum of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["cerebellum p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151520","Is part of":"Hindbrain of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"Segmentation of the cerebellum is straightforward and can be done on virtually any MR contrast in the coronal and\/or sagittal plane. A majority of the border between the cerebellum and the rest of the hindbrain is defined by ventricle. The major difficulty is in deciding how to apportion the territory of the cerebellar peduncles, which traverse the cerebellum\/hindbrain border. One solution is to follow a best-fit line between the vestibular nuclei medially and the cochlear nuclei laterally and use that as a dividing line between cerebellum and hindbrain."}}
