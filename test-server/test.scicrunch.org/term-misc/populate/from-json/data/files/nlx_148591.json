The cell body fiber runs anteriormedially and diverges above the ellipsoid body, with most of the branches arborizing in the anterior part of the inferior neuropils. One fiber turns dorsolaterally, runs in front of the anterior surface of the vertical lobe and terminates in the middle of the inferior neuropils. On the way, one fiber branches off and arborizes in the anterior and middle of the superior neuropils. Another fiber turns ventromedially and projects to the opposite hemisphere. A third fiber turns ventrolaterally, runs in front of the anterior surface of the gamma lobe and then below the gamma lobe, and arborizes in the spur of the gamma lobe and inner core of the pedunculus."}}
