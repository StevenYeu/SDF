The soma measures from 12 to 17 micrometers in its widest axis and is nearly spherical, having a rather smooth profile. The soma issues two or three short primary dendrites, which usually run horizontally. After a short distance (10 to 40 micrometers), these proximal branches give rise to sets of two to five long, secondary dendrites. The occurrence of third to order dendrites is variable, as is their length (20 to 150 micrometers). A defining characteristic of BN dendrites is the presence of distinct varicosities that are virtually devoid of dendritic spines.  The BN axon and its collaterals also exhibit a series of small spherules (0.3-0.5 um) united by thin axonal bridges (Lariva-Sahd, 2006, as reported in  http:\/\/brancusi.usc.edu\/bkms)."}}
