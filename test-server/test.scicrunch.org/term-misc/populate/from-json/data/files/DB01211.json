It can inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria by reversibly binding to the 50S ribosomal subunits. This inhibits the translocation of aminoacyl transfer-RNA and prevents peptide chain elongation. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Clarithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic similar to erythromycin and azithromycin, is effective against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and is used for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori-associated peptic ulcer disease, community-acquired pneumonia, sinusitis, and chronic bronchitis. Clarithromycin is also used to treat respiratory tract, sexually transmitted, otitis media, and AIDS-related infections. Mechanism of action: Clarithromycin is first metabolized to 14-OH clarithromycin. Like other macrolides, it then binds to the 50 S subunit of the 70 S ribosome of the bacteria, blocking RNA-mediated bacterial protein synthesis. Clarithromycin also inhibits the hepatic microsomal CYP3A4 isoenzyme and P-glycoprotein, an energy-dependent drug efflux pump. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule.
