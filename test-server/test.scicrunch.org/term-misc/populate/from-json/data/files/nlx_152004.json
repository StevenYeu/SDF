{"Dorsolateral entorhinal area of RHA11":{"CytoDefiningCriteria":["Layer I is thin","and differs characteristically from what is seen in all other subdivisions of the entorhinal cortex in that it is populated by neurons that look like displaced layer II cells. Layer II is rather thin and densely packed with darkly stained elongated","big neurons. The long axis of many of these neurons runs parallel to the outer surface of the ventral bank of the rhinal fissure. Layer III is also thin","and the cells are organized in horizontal rows","parallel to the surface curvature of the rhinal fissure. The outer portion of this layer has a higher cell density than the inner one. A cell sparse layer IV separates layers III and V.Layer V has a few very big and darkly stained neurons","while the remaining neurons are medium-sized. Layer VI is more compact than layer V","and its cells larger than the layer VI cells of the immediately adjacent DIE. Layer VI is obliquely oriented","so that the long axes of the neurons are parallel to the surface of the medial bank of the rhinal fissure.

At caudal levels it occupies both banks of the rhinal fissure, while anteriorly it lies medial or ventral to the rhinal fissure. It is positioned between the perirhinal cortex dorsally and the dorsal-intermediate entorhinal area (DIE) ventrally. "}}
