Its mode of action is not fully understood, but some of its actions resemble those of phenytoin; although there is little chemical resemblance between the two compounds, their three-dimensional structure is similar. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant structurally similar to tricyclic antidepressants, is used to treat partial seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, pain of neurologic origin such as trigeminal neuralgia, and psychiatric disorders including manic-depressive illness and aggression due to dementia. Mechanism of action: Carbamazepine inhibits sustained repetitive firing by blocking use-dependent sodium channels. Pain relief is believed to be associated with blockade of synaptic transmission in the trigeminal nucleus and seizure control with reduction of post-tetanic potentiation of synaptic transmission in the spinal cord. Carbamazepine also possesses anticholinergic, central antidiuretic, antiarrhythmic, muscle relaxant, antidepressant (possibly through blockade of norepinephrine release), sedative, and neuromuscular-blocking properties.
