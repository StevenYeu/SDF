The drug is used for the treatment of duodenal ulcers. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Nizatidine is a competitive, reversible inhibitor of histamine at the histamine H2-receptors, particularly those in the gastric parietal cells. By inhibiting the action of histamine on stomach cells, nizatidine reduces stomach acid production. Nizatidine had no demonstrable antiandrogenic action. Full-dose therapy for the problems treated by nizatidine lasts no longer than 8 weeks. It has been demonstrated that treatment with a reduced dose of nizatidine is effective as maintenance therapy following healing of active duodenal ulcers. Mechanism of action: Nizatidine competes with histamine for binding at the H2-receptors on the gastric basolateral membrane of parietal cells. Competitive inhibition results in reduction of basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretions. The drug also decreases the gastric acid response to stimuli such as food, caffeine, insulin, betazole, or pentagastrin. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Ulcer Agents. Histamine H2 Antagonists"}}
