It is used for superficial wounds, burns, ulcers, and skin infections. Nitrofurazone has also been administered orally in the treatment of trypanosomiasis. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Nitrofurazone is a topical antibacterial agent indicated as an adjunctive therapy for second and third degree burns when resistance to other agents is a real or potential problem. Nitrofurazone is also indicated in skin grafting when bacterial contamination may cause graft rejection or donor site infection, especially in hospitals with a history of resistant bacteria. Mechanism of action: The exact mechanism of action is unknown. Nitrofurazone inhibits several bacterial enzymes, especially those involved in the aerobic and anaerobic degradation of glucose and pyruvate. This activity is believed also to affect pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate synthetase, malate dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, and pyruvate decarboxylase. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule.
