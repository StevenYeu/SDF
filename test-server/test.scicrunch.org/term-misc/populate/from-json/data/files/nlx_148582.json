The cell body fiber travels ventrally towards the medial lobe, running along the anterior surface of the gamma lobe, turning medially at the bottom of the gamma lobe and forming a terminal in the most medial segment of the gamma lobe. The main fiber then enters the opposite gamma lobe, runs dorsolaterally through the border between the gamma and beta' lobes, arborizing in the inferior and superior neuropils.","hasDBXref":"FlyBrain_NDB:10459"}}
