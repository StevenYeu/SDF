It has a longer elimination half-life than any currently available cephalosporin. Its activity is very similar to that of cefamandole, a second-generation cephalosporin, except that ceforanide is less active against most gram-positive organisms. Many coliforms, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Proteus, are susceptible to ceforanide, as are most strains of Salmonella, Shigella, Hemophilus, Citrobacter and Arizona species. Pharmacology: Ceforanide is a semisynthetic second-generation cephalosporin. The cephalosporins are bactericidal drugs with both gram-positive and gram-negative activity. They inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis in a way similar to the penicillins. Mechanism of action: The bactericidal activity of ceforanide results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents. Cephalosporins"}}
