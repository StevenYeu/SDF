(PubChem) Pharmacology: Oxprenolol is a non-selective beta blocker with some intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Oxprenolol is a lipophilic beta blocker which passes the blood-brain barrier more easily than water soluble beta blockers. As such, it is associated with a higher incidence of CNS-related side effects than hydrophilic ligands such as atenolol, sotalol and nadolol. Oxprenolol is an potent beta-blocker and should not be administered to asthmatics because it can cause irreversible airway failure and inflammation. Mechanism of action: Like other beta-adrenergic antagonists, oxprenolol competes with adrenergic neurotransmitters such as catecholamines for binding at sympathetic receptor sites. Like propranolol and timolol, oxprenolol binds at beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle, inhibiting the effects of the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine and decreasing heart rate, cardiac output, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. It also blocks beta-2 adrenergic receptors located in bronchiole smooth muscle, causing vasoconstriction. By binding beta-2 receptors in the juxtaglomerular apparatus, oxprenolol inhibits the production of renin, thereby inhibiting angiotensin II and aldosterone production. Oxprenolol therefore inhibits the vasoconstriction and water retention due to angiotensin II and aldosterone, respectively. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule.
