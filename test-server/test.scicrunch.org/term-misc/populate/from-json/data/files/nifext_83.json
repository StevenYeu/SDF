However, even after a large injection of retrograde tracer into the medial geniculate body (MGB), a main target of IC projection, most small GABAergic neurons, which lack dense excitatory axosomatic terminals, were not labeled with the tracer. On the other hand, large GABAergic neurons send axons to the MGB."}}
