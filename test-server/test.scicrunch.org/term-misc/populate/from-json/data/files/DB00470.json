The isomer delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is considered the most active form, producing characteristic mood and perceptual changes associated with this compound. Dronabinol is a synthetic form of delta-9-THC. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Dronabinol may has complex effects on the central nervous system (CNS), including cannabinoid receptors. Dronabinol may inhibit endorphins in the emetic center, suppress prostaglandin synthesis, and\/or inhibit medullary activity through an unspecified cortical action. Mechanism of action: The mechanism of action of dronabinol is not completely understood. It is thought that cannabinoid receptors in neural tissues may mediate the effects of dronabinol and other cannabinoids. Animal studies with other cannabinoids suggest that dronabinol's antiemetic effects may be due to inhibition of the vomiting control mechanism in the medulla oblongata. Drug type: Approved. Illicit.
