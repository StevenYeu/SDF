(PubChem) Pharmacology: Enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is a prodrug which, when hydrolyzed by estarases to its active Enalaprilat, is used to treat hypertension and heart failure, to reduce proteinuria and renal disease in patients with nephropathies, and to prevent stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiac death in high-risk patients. Enalapril and enalaprilat inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Mechanism of action: Enalaprilat, the active metabolite of enalapril, competes with angiotensin I for binding at the angiotensin-converting enzyme, blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and a negative-feedback mediator for renin activity, lower concentrations result in a decrease in blood pressure and stimulation of baroreceptor reflex mechanisms, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. Enalaprilat may also act on kininase II, an enzyme identical to ACE that degrades the vasodilator bradykinin. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule.
