{"Cadherin":{"SuperCategory":"Protein","Id":"sao1463925374","Definition":"A group of functionally related glycoproteins responsible for the calcium-dependent cell-to-cell adhesion mechanism. They are divided into subclasses E-, P-, and N-cadherins, which are distinct in immunological specificity and tissue distribution. They promote cell adhesion via a homophilic mechanism. These compounds play a role in the construction of tissues and of the whole animal body (MSH)."}}
