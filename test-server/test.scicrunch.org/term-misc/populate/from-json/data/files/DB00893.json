Iron Dextran is used for the treatment of patients with documented iron deficiency in which oral administration is unsatisfactory or impossible. Pharmacology: Iron dextran is a dark brown, slightly viscous sterile liquid complex of ferric hydroxide and dextran for intravenous or intramuscular use. It is for treatment of patients with documented iron deficiency in whom oral administration is unsatisfactory or impossible. Iron is essential to the formation of hemoglobin and to the function and formation of other heme and nonheme compounds. Untreated depletion of iron stores leads to iron-deficient erythropoiesis and, in turn, to iron deficiency anemia. Mechanism of action: After iron dextran is injected, the circulating iron dextran is removed from the plasma by cells of the reticuloendothelial system, which split the complex into its components of iron and dextran. The iron is immediately bound to the available protein moieties to form hemosiderin or ferritin, the physiological forms of iron, or to a lesser extent to transferrin. This iron which is subject to physiological control replenishes hemoglobin and depleted iron stores. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-anemic Agents. Iron Supplement"}}
