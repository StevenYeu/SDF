(PubChem) Pharmacology: Rimantadine, a cyclic amine, is a synthetic antiviral drug and a derivate of adamantane, like a similar drug amantadine. Rimantadine is inhibitory to the in vitro replication of influenza A virus isolates from each of the three antigenic subtypes (H1N1, H2H2 and H3N2) that have been isolated from man. Rimantadine has little or no activity against influenza B virus. Rimantadine does not appear to interfere with the immunogenicity of inactivated influenza A vaccine. Mechanism of action: The mechanism of action of rimantadine is not fully understood. Rimantadine appears to exert its inhibitory effect early in the viral replicative cycle, possibly inhibiting the uncoating of the virus. Genetic studies suggest that a virus protein specified by the virion M2 gene plays an important role in the susceptibility of influenza A virus to inhibition by rimantadine. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antiviral Agents. Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors"}}
