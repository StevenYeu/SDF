Normal cells, however, are able to synthesize asparagine and thus are affected less by the rapid depletion produced by treatment with the enzyme asparaginase. Elspar exploits a metabolic defect in asparagine synthesis of some malignant cells. Mechanism of action: Asparaginase converts asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia. It facilitates production of oxaloacetate which is needed for general cellular metabolism. Some malignant cells lose the ability to produce asparagine and so the loss of exogenous sources of asparagine leads to cell death. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Antineoplastic Agents"}}
