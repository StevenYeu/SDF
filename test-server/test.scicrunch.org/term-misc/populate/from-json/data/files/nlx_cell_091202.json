The cell body is 6-8 um in diameter, from which arises a short bushy dendrite that arborizes within a glomerulus, where it receives synaptic input from olfactory receptor cell axon terminals, and engages in dendrodendritic interactions with mitral\/tufted cell dendrites.  Occasionally, bitufted PG cells connected to two glomeruli are seen.  The axon distributes laterally within the extraglomerular region, extending as far as 5-10 glomeruli away.  Some PG cells appear to lack axons.  Subtypes may be identified based on their biochemical constituents."}}
