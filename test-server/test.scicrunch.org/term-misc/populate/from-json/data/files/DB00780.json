(PubChem) Pharmacology: Phenelzine belongs to a class of antidepressants called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Phenelzine works by irreversibly blocking the action of a chemical substance known as monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the nervous system. Within neurons, MAO appears to regulate the levels of monoamines released upon synaptic firing. Since depression is associated with low levels of monoamines, the inhibition of MAO serves to ease depressive symptoms. Mechanism of action: The irreversible inhibition of MAO by phenelzine causes an increase in the levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the neuron, relieving depressive symptoms. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antidepressants. Antidepressive Agents. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors"}}
