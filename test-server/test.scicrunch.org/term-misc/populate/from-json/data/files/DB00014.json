In men, it stops the production of the hormone testosterone, which may stimulate the growth of cancer cells. In women, goserelin decreases the production of the hormone estradiol (which may stimulate the growth of cancer cells) to levels similar to a postmenopausal state. When the medication is stopped, hormone levels return to normal. Pharmacology: The pharmacokinetics of ZOLADEX have been determined in both male and female healthy volunteers and patients. In these studies, ZOLADEX was administered as a single 250g (aqueous solution) dose and as a single or multiple 3.6 mg depot dose by subcutaneous route. Mechanism of action: ZOLADEX is a synthetic decapeptide analogue of LHRH. ZOLADEX acts as a potent inhibitor of pituitary gonadotropin secretion when administered in the biodegradable formulation. The result is sustained suppression of LH and serum testosterone levels. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Antineoplastic Agents. Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal"}}
