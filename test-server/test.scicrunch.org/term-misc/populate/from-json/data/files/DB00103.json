The mature protein is composed of 2 subunits of 398 residues. Protein is glycosylated and produced by CHO cells Pharmacology: Used in the treatment of Fabry disease, an X-linked genetic disorder of glycosphingolipid metabolism. The disease is characterized by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A, which leads to progressive accumulation of glycosphingolipids, predominantly GL-3, in many body tissues. Clinical manifestations of Fabry disease include renal failure, cardiomyopathy, and cerebrovascular accidents. Fabrazyme is intended to provide an exogenous source of alpha-galactosidase A and to limit the accumulation of these glycolipids in the tissues. Mechanism of action: Alpha-galactosidase A catalyzes the hydrolysis of globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) and other a-galactyl-terminated neutral glycosphingolipids, such as galabiosylceramide and blood group B substances to ceramide dihexoside and galactose. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Enzyme Replacement Agents"}}
