The cells are defined by the lack of overall orientation to the dendritic fields which extend symmetrically from the cell body. Stellate cells are multipolar with dendrites arising from any portion of the cell body. The dendrites may range anywhere from gnarled to radiate with the gnarled spiny cells most frequent in the zone of horizontal cells and the smooth radiate cells increasingly more frequent in the deeper zones until they are almost the only cell type in the zones below the stratum opticum. The dimensions of the cell bodies and dendritic fields are comparable to those of other cells in the same zone and the dendritic field is generally contained within the same zone as the cell body. The axons of stellate cells have both local and\/or distant distributions and a morphology characteristic of intrinsic axons. As with all the other cell types, the axon may take its origin from the cell body or a low order dendrite."}}
