{"Metachromatic Leukodystrophy":{"Synonym":["Arylsulfatase A Deficiency Disease","Greenfield's Disease","Cerebroside Sulphatase Deficiency Disease"],"Created":"2007-10-05","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Hereditary Central Nervous System Demyelinating Diseases","Id":"birnlex_12542","Definition":"An autosomal recessive metabolic disease caused by a deficiency of arylsulfatase A (CEREBROSIDE-SULFATASE) leading to intralysosomal accumulation of cerebroside sulfate ( SULFOGLYCOSPHINGOLIPIDS) in the nervous system and other organs. Pathological features include diffuse demyelination, and metachromatically-staining granules in many cell types such as the GLIAL CELLS. There are several allelic and nonallelic forms with a variety of neurological symptoms (MeSH)."}}
