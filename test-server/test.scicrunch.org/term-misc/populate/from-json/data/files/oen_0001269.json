{"Receptor potential":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Membrane potential","Id":"oen_0001269","Definition":"An initial response of a receptor cell to a stimulus, consisting of a change in voltage across the receptor membrane proportional to the stimulus strength. The intensity of the receptor potential determines the frequency of action potentials traveling to the nervous system."}}
