In fatty acid synthesis, reported to bind in equimolar ratio to b-keto-acyl-ACP synthase. In sterol synthesis, inhibits HMG-CoA synthetase activity. It is also shown to inhibit feeding and induce dramatic weight loss in mice. It is found naturally in the Cephalosporium caerulensfungus. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Cerulenin is an antifungal antibiotic isolated from Cephalosporium caerulens. It interrupts fungal growth by inhibiting the biosynthesis of sterols and fatty acids (inhibits bacterial fatty acid synthesis). It also inhibits HMG-CoA synthetase activity. Cerulenin produces metabolic effects similar to effects of leptin, but through mechanisms that are independent of, or down-stream from, both leptin and melanocortin receptors. Mechanism of action: Irreversibly binds to fatty acid synthase, specifically b-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (FabH, FabB and FabF condensation enzymes). A number of tumor cells and cell lines have been observed to have highly upregulated expression and activity of fatty acid synthase (FAS). Inhibition of FAS by cerulenin leads to cytotoxicity and apoptosis in human cancer cell lines, an effect believed to be mediated by the accumulation of malonyl-coenzyme A in cells with an upregulated FAS pathway. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antibiotics, Antifungal. Fatty Acid Synthesis Inhibitors"}}
