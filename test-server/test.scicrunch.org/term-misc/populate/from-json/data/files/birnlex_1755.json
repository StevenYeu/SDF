{"Brodmann (1909) area 24":{"NeuronamesLink":"http:\/\/braininfo.rprc.washington.edu\/Scripts\/hiercentraldirectory.aspx?ID","Created":"2007-10-02","EditorialNote":"Note that NN also includes area 24 of Brodmann-1905, which has the following definition: The term area 24 of Brodmann-1905 refers to a cytoarchitecturally defined area of the CEREBRAL CORTEX in the guenon. It includes portions of the CINGULATE GYRUS and the FRONTAL LOBE. The cortex is thin; it lacks the internal granular layer (IV) so that the densely distributed, plump pyramidal cells of sublayer 3b of the external pyramidal layer (III) merge with similar cells of the internal pyramidal layer (V); the multiform layer (VI) is very thin (Brodmann-1905). Note that Brodmann later divided this area into two areas, area 24 of Brodmann-1909 and area 25 of Brodmann-1909 (Brodmann-1909)., The lobular mapping of Brodmann areas has been adapted from the LOCATION hierarchy in Brainmap.org.  To date (2007-10-02) this only define the set of lateralized cerebral lobe locations where a given Brodmann area is located.  The intension is to eventually incorporate the more detailed gyri and sulci relations as well.","Synonym":["Area cingularis anterior ventralis","area 24 of Brodmann-1909","ventral anterior cingulate","Brodmann area 24"],"NeuronamesID":"1043865377","CurationStatus":"uncurated","Umlscui":"C1272542","SuperCategory":"Brodmann partition scheme region","Id":"birnlex_1755","Abbrev":"B09-24"}}
