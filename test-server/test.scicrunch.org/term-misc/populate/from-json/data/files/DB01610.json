As the L-valyl ester of ganciclovir, it is actually a prodrug for ganciclovir. After oral administration, it is rapidly converted to ganciclovir by intestinal and hepatic esterases. Pharmacology: Valganciclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat cytomegalovirus infections. As the L-valyl ester of ganciclovir, it is actually a prodrug for ganciclovir. After oral administration, it is rapidly converted to ganciclovir by intestinal and hepatic esterases. Mechanism of action: Valganciclovir is a prodrug of ganciclovir that exists as a mixture of two diastereomers. After administration, these diastereomers are rapidly converted to ganciclovir by hepatic and intestinal esterases. In cytomegalovirus (CMV)-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to the monophosphate form by viral protein kinase, then it is further phosphorylated via cellular kinases to produce the triphosphate form. This triphosphate form is slowly metabolized intracellularly. The phosphorylation is dependent upon the viral kinase, and occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to the inhibition of viral DNA synthesis by ganciclovir triphosphate. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antiviral Agents"}}
