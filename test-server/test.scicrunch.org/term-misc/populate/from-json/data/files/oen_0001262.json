MM","The GO definition is incorrect","in physics the increase of an electrical potential means that the potential difference between positive and negative sides is larger","at rest of a neuron this means a hyperpolarization or a decrease of postsynaptic potential","not an increase"],"Id":"oen_0001262","Has role":"Electrophysiology concept","Xref":"nlx_qual_20090501","Definition":"A temporary change in postsynaptic membrane potential, usually a depolarization, resulting from presynaptic release of neurotransmitter. This is usually due to the flow of positively charged ions into the postsynaptic cell, but can also be due to a reduction in negatively charged ionic current or the turning off of a potassium current.  An EPSP generally increases the likelihood of action potential discharge in the postsynaptic neuron.  In common usage, the EPSP typically refers to an evoked EPSP.","Abbrev":"EPSP"}}
