{"Caspofungin":{"RelatedTo":"Beta-1,3-glucan synthase","Synonym":["Capsofungin","Caspofungin acetate"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB00520","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB00520","Definition":"Caspofungin (brand name Cancidas worldwide) is an antifungal drug, the first of a new class termed the echinocandins from Merck & Co., Inc. It shows activity against infections with Aspergillus and Candida, and works by inhibiting (1,3)-D-Glucan of the fungal cell wall. Caspofungin is administered intravenously. Pharmacology: Caspofungin is an antifungal drug, and belongs to a new class termed the echinocandins. It is used to treat Aspergillus and Candida infection, and works by inhibiting cell wall synthesis. Antifungals in the echinocandin class inhibit the synthesis of glucan in the cell wall, probably via the enzyme 1,3-beta glucan synthase. There is a potential for resistance development to occur, however in vitro resistance development to Caspofungin by Aspergillus species has not been studied. Mechanism of action: Caspofungin inhibits the synthesis of b (1,3)-D-glucan, an essential component of the cell wall of Aspergillus species and Candida species. b (1,3)-D-glucan is not present in mammalian cells. The primary target is beta-(1,3)-glucan synthase. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antifungal Agents. Antifungals"}}
