The field overlaps with other areas of biology and chemistry, particularly genetics and biochemistry. Molecular biology chiefly concerns itself with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell, including the interactions between DNA, RNA and protein biosynthesis as well as learning how these interactions are regulated.Writing in Nature, William Astbury described molecular biology as:\"(...)not so much a technique as an approach, an approach from the viewpoint of the so-called basic sciences with the leading idea of searching below the large-scale manifestations of classical biology for the corresponding molecular plan. It is concerned particularly with the forms of biological molecules and(...) is predominantly three-dimensional and structural\u2013which does not mean, however, that it is merely a refinement of morphology. It must at the same time inquire into genesis and function.\" - definition adapted from Wikipedia"}}
