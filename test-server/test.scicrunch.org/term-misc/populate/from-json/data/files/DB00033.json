Production of Actimmune is achieved by fermentation of a genetically engineered Escherichia coli bacterium containing the DNA which encodes for the human protein. Purification of the product is achieved by conventional column chromatography. Pharmacology: IFN gamma stimulates expression of the immunoglobulin heavy chain C gamma 3 and C gamma 2a germline transcripts in B cells. Many components of the antigen presentation pathways are also up-regulated by interferon gamma. It is also a potent activator of macrophages, it has antiproliferative effects on transformed cells and it can potentiate the antiviral and antitumor effects of type I interferons. Interferon gamma may also help the body regulate the activity of fibroblasts. By directly blocking the multiplication of fibroblasts and inhibiting the production and action of TGF-b, a potent scar-inducing molecule, Interferon gamma-1b may prevent excessive scarring. Mechanism of action: Binds directly to the type II interferon gamma receptor IFNGR1, leading to a complex of IFNGR1 and IFNGR2. This activates JAK1 and JAK2 kinases which form a STAT1 docking site. This leads to STAT1 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and initiation of gene transcription of multiple immune-related genes. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Antiviral Agents. Immunomodulatory Agents"}}
