(Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Cefmenoxime is a semisynthetic beta-lactam cephalosporin antibiotic with activity similar to that of cefotaxime. It has broad spectrum activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Mechanism of action: The bactericidal activity of cefmenoxime results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cefmenoxime is stable in the presence of a variety of b-lactamases, including penicillinases and some cephalosporinases. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents.
