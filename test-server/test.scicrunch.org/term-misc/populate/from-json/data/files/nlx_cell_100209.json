The CA1 Interneuron Specific (IS) Type I cells is one of the many IS cell types from the CA1 region. The soma is located in stratum radiatum and pyramidale with dendrites spanning most layers and the axon innervating mainly calbindin positive and other calretinin positive cells (Acsady et al. 1996b; Gulyas et al. 1996). The possible expression of VIP by these cells is not known."}}
