{"Vesicular glutamate transporter 2":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Protein","Id":"nlx_mol_1006009","Has role":["Transporter Protein"],"Abbrev":"VGLUT2","Definition":"Protein that mediates the uptake of glutamate into synaptic vesicles at presynaptic nerve terminals of excitatory neural cells. May also play a role in the endocrine glutamatergic system of other tissues such as pineal gland and pancreas. May also mediate the transport of inorganic phosphate. (Adapted from UniProt)"}}
