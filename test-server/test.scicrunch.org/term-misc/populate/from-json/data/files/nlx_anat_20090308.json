This representation of the visual field (MT) corresponds to a histologically distinct area adjacent and rostral to area 19... The horizontal meridian divides MT into a lateral portion representing the upper visual quadrant and a medial portion representing  the lower quadrant.  The center of gaze is represented in the caudal portion of MT bordering area 19.\""}}
