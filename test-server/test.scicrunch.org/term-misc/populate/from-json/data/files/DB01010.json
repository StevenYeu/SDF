It has also been used as an antidote to curare principles. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Edrophonium is a short and rapid-acting anticholinesterase drug. Its effect is manifest within 30 to 60 seconds after injection and lasts an average of 10 minutes. Edrophonium's pharmacologic action is due primarily to the inhibition or inactivation of acetylcholinesterase at sites of cholinergic transmission. Muscarinic receptors are found throughout the body, especially on muscle. Stimulation of these receptors causes to muscle contraction. In myasthenia gravis the body's immune system destroys many of the muscarinic receptors, so that the muscle becomes less responsive to nervous stimulation. Edrophonium chloride increases the amount of acetylcholine at the nerve endings. Increased levels of acetyl choline allow the remaining receptors to function more efficiently. Mechanism of action: Edrophonium works by prolonging the action acetylcholine, which is found naturally in the body. It does this by inhibiting the action of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Acetylcholine stimulates a type of receptor called muscarinic receptors. When stimulated, these receptors have a range of effects. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antidotes. Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}}
