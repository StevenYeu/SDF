It is available as its hydrochloride salt in ophthalmic solutions at a concentration of 0.5%. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Proparacaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action. More specifically, proparacaine appears to bind or antagonize the function of voltage gated sodium channels. Mechanism of action: The exact mechanism whereby proparacaine and other local anesthetics influence the permeability of the cell membrane is unknown; however, several studies indicate that local anesthetics may limit sodium ion permeability through the lipid layer of the nerve cell membrane. Proparacaine may alter epithelial sodium channels through interaction with channel protein residues. This limitation prevents the fundamental change necessary for the generation of the action potential. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anesthetics, Local. Local Anesthetics"}}
