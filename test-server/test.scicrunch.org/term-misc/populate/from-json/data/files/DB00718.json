It is a failed treatment for HIV. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Adefovir dipivoxil a diester prodrug of adefovir. Adefovir is an acyclic nucleotide analog with activity against human hepatitis B virus (HBV). The concentration of adefovir that inhibited 50% of viral DNA synthesis (IC50) in vitro ranged from 0.2 to 2.5 M in HBV transfected human hepatoma cell lines. The combination of adefovir with lamivudine showed additive anti-HBV activity. Mechanism of action: Adefovir dipivoxil is a prodrug of adefovir. Adefovir is an acyclic nucleotide analog of adenosine monophosphate which is phosphorylated to the active metabolite adefovir diphosphate by cellular kinases. Adefovir diphosphate inhibits HBV DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine triphosphate and by causing DNA chain termination after its incorporation into viral DNA. The inhibition constant (Ki) for adefovir diphosphate for HBV DNA polymerase was 0.1 M. Adefovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of human DNA polymerases  and  with Ki values of 1.18 M and 0.97M, respectively. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antiviral Agents. Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors"}}
