{"International Standard Book Number":{"Created":"2007-10-11","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Identifying value","Id":"birnlex_2388","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/isbntools.com\/","Abbrev":"ISBN","Definition":"An ISBN is a 10-digit or 13-digit number that identifies a book for purposes of commerce and supply chains. The last digit of the ISBN is a check digit used to detect transcription errors. This last digit is sometimes an \"x\". 13 digit ISBNs began to appear on January 1 2005, and all ISBN systems are required to support 13 digits by January 1, 2007.The first number or numbers of a 10 digit ISBN identifies the country that issued the publishers prefix; this number is followed by a dash and the publisher prefix. 13-digit ISBN's start with either 978 or 979, and the 9 digits that follow correspond to the first 9 digits of a 10-digit ISBN.The dashes (or spaces) in the ISBN occur in different places depending on the number and are meaningful, but are so frequently omitted that you can't really use the dashes for much."}}
