It encompasses the caudal levels of area 35 and the caudal portion of area 36 (ectorhinal cortex).  It is bordered medially by agranular retrosplenial cortex and ventrally by the entorhinal cortex (with the exception of the caudomedial portion).  The authors note that the ventral portion of the postrhinal cortex in rat may by homologous with the parahippocampal cortex in the monkey."}}
