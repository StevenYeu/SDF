{"Methacycline":{"RelatedTo":"50S ribosomal protein L10","Synonym":["Metacycline","Methacyclin"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB00931","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB00931","Definition":"A broad-spectrum semisynthetic antibiotic related to tetracycline but excreted more slowly and maintaining effective blood levels for a more extended period. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Methacycline, a macrolide antibiotic similar to erythromycin and azithromycin, is effective against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and is used for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori-associated peptic ulcer disease, community-acquired pneumonia, sinusitis, and chronic bronchitis. Methacycline is also used to treat respiratory tract, sexually transmitted, otitis media, and AIDS-related infections. Mechanism of action: Methacycline is first metabolized to 14-OH Methacycline. Like other macrolides, it then binds to the 50 S subunit of the 70 S ribosome of the bacteria, blocking RNA-mediated bacterial protein synthesis. Methacycline also inhibits the hepatic microsomal CYP3A4 isoenzyme and P-glycoprotein, an energy-dependent drug efflux pump. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents. Tetracyclines"}}
