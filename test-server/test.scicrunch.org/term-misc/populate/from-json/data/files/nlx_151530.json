{"Isocortex of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["cortex p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151530","Is part of":"Pallium of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"The isocortex can be easily segmented in the coronal plane with virtually any image contrast. In most places, the border between the isocortex and the rest of the forebrain is defined by a collection of white matter bundles, which have a very different appearance under most MRI contrasts. The border between the isocortex and other parts of the cortex (olfactory cortex, amygdala etc.) is somewhat more difficult. Rostrally, the isocortex and olfactory cortex are divided by the thin rostral extent of the lateral olfactory tract, which appears much darker on T2 MRI. A horizontal line connecting the two rhinal fissures that is slightly convex towards the dorsal surface of brain approximates the dividing line between these two regions of cortex as far caudal as the mamillary bodies. Caudal to the mamillary bodies the dividing line between isocortex and piriform cortex can be defined based on the dorsal extent of later 2 of the piriform cortex, which appears quite dark (high diffusivity) of diffusion-weighted images. At roughly the caudal extent of the amygdala (the posteromedial cortical amygdaloid nucleus) the piriform cortex disappears abruptly giving way to the entorhinal cortex, which we have included in the isocortex. Further caudal, the isocortex is free-floating on all sides, and is only interrupted in its center by the caudal corpus callosum and subiculum, which tend to have a dark border on T2 MRI that contrasts nicely with the pale-appearing cortex."}}
