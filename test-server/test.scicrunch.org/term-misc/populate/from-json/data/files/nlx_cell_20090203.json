Most of the dendrites are very long giving a thick network of secondary and tertiary dendritic branches in a radial three dimensional arrangement in the neuropil space. The secondary and tertiary dendritic branches are studded with long fusiform or triangular spines (Baloyannis, S. J., Costa, V., Psaroulis, V., Arzoglou, L. Papsotiriou (1994) The nucleus basalis of Meynert of the human brain:  a Golgi and electron microscope study) Int J Neurosci., 78:  33-41."}}
