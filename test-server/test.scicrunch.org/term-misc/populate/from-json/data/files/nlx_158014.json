{"4Pi microscopy":{"EditorialNote":"Trying to unify the assay and protocol branches, as I think it leads to unnecessary duplication for search.  Decided to go with protocol","CurationStatus":"graph position temporary","SuperCategory":"Optical imaging protocol","Curator":["Maryann Martone"],"Id":"nlx_158014","Has role":"Super-resolution microscopy","Definition":"Imaging assay that utilizes a 4Pi microscope, a laser scanning fluorescence microscope with an improved axial resolution. The typical value of 500\u2013700 nm can be improved to 100\u2013150 nm, which corresponds to an almost spherical focal spot with 5\u20137 times less volume than that of standard confocal microscopy.  The improvement in resolution is achieved by using two opposing objective lenses both of which focused to the same geometrical location. Also the difference in optical path length through each of the two objective lenses is carefully aligned to be minimal. By this, molecules residing in the common focal area of both objectives can be illuminated coherently from both sides and also the reflected or emitted light can be collected coherently, i.e. coherent superposition of emitted light on the detector is possible.
