{"Cholera toxin B-chain":{"RelatedTo":"Neuronal tract tracing","Synonym":["Cholera toxin B"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Id":"nlx_152233","Has role":"Tracing role","Is part of":"Cholera toxin","Abbrev":"CTB","Definition":"A protein complex secreted by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, comprising an oligomeric complex made up of six protein subunits: a single copy of the A subunit (part A, enzymatic), and five copies of the B subunit (part B, receptor binding), denoted as AB5.  Cholera toxin acts by the B subunit ring of the cholera toxin binding to GM1 gangliosides on the surface of target cells. Once bound, the entire toxin complex is endocytosed by the cell and the cholera toxin A1 (CTA1) chain is released by the reduction of a disulfide bridge.
