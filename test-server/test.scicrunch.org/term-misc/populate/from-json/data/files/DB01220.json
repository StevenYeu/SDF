It is used to treat diarrhea caused by E. coli. Pharmacology: Rifaximin is a structural analog of rifampin and non-systemic, gastrointestinal site-specific antibiotic. Rifaximin acts by inhibiting bacterial ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis. While an increase in pulmonary hydrogen excretion is evident in diverticular disease, the therapeutic effect of rifaximin does not appear to be due to a persistent correction of this alteration and the drug appears to cause no significant imbalance in the intestinal ecosystem. Mechanism of action: Rifaximin is a product of synthesis of rifamycin, an antibiotic with low gastrointestinal absorption and good antibacterial activity (Marchi et al, 1985). It acts on the beta-subunit of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-dependent ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase enzyme of microorganisms to inhibit RNA synthesis. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Infective Agents. Gastrointestinal Agents"}}
