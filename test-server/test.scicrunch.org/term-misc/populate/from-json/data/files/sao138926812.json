NACHRA7 is a type of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, consisting entirely of \u03b17 subunits. As with other nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, functional \u03b17 receptors are pentameric [i.e., (\u03b17)5 stoichiometry]. It is located in the brain, where activation yields post- and presynaptic excitation, mainly by increased Ca2+ permeability. (Definition provided by PRotein Ontology and Wikipedia)."}}
