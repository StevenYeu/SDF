With parallel forms of WAIS-IIIUK and WISC-IIIUK subtests, it offers the clinician a means of reducing practice effects on repeat testing. It yields traditional verbal, performance and full scale IQ scores and is linked to the WISC-IIIUK and WAIS-IIIUK. The WASI allows you to choose whether to use the four or two subtest format."}}
