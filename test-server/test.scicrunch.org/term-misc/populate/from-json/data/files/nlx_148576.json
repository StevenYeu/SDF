There are 3 of these per hemisphere. Their cell bodies form a cluster. The cell body fiber runs ventrally and bifurcates near the protocerebral bridge to form a laterodorsal and a lateroventral projection. The dorsal projection arborizes in the superior and inferior neuropils, with some branches entering the accessory calyx of the mushroom body. Some of these fibers connect the accessory calyx and the ventral peripheral zone of the main calyx. The ventral projection forms extensive arborization in the superior and inferior neuropils, and further projects to the posteriorlateral protocerebrum.","hasDBXref":"FlyBrain_NDB:10452"}}
