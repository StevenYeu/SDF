CA3 IS-II cell type is visualized by immunostaining for VIP. IS-II neurons are characterized in hippocampus alone, where their somata are found in stratum radiatum. The dendritic tree consists of a tuft of smooth or sparsely spiny dendrites restricted to stratum lacunosum-moleculare, where they profusely arborize. The axon descends toward stratum pyramidale, thus forming weeping willowlike arbor."}}
