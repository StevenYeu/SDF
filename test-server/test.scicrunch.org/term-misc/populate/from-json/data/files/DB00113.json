The molecule has a molecular weight of ~54,000 Daltons. Pharmacology: Binds to the carcinoembryonic antigen, which is a cell surface protein generally overexpressed in colon (and other) cancers. The radioactive Tc99, which is covalently attached to the antibody, allows radiodiagnostic detection of CEA expressing cells and tumors Mechanism of action: Binds selectively to cell-surface carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) expressed on colorectal tumors. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Diagnostic Agents. Imaging Agents"}}
