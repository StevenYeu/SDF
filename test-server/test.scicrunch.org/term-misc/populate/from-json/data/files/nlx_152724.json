{"Cre-recombinase":{"Synonym":["Cre"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Enzyme","Id":"nlx_152724","Is part of":"CRE-lox recombination system","Species":"Bacteria","Definition":"A tyrosine recombinase enzyme derived from the P1 Bacteriophage. The enzyme uses a topoisomerase I like mechanism to carry out site specific recombination events. The enzyme (38kDa) is a member of the Integrase family of site specific recombinase and it is known to catalyse the site specific recombination event between two DNA recognition sites (loxP sites).  Cre recombinase is a widely used tool in the field of molecular biology. The enzyme's unique and specific recombination system is exploited to manipulate genes and chromosomes in a huge range of research, such as gene knock out or knock in studies. The enzyme's ability to operate efficiently in a wide range of cellular environments (including mammals, plants, bacteria, and yeast) enables the Cre-Lox recombination system to be used in a vast number of organisms, making it a particularly useful tool in scientific research (Adapted from Wikipedia:  http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cre_recombinase)"}}
