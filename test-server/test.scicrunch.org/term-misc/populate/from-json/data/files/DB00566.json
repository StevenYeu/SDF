{"Succimer":{"Synonym":["DMSA","Dimercaptosuccinic acid","Chemet"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB00566","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB00566","Definition":"A mercaptodicarboxylic acid used as an antidote to heavy metal poisoning because it forms strong chelates with them. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Succimer is an orally active, heavy metal chelating agent. It forms water soluble chelates and, consequently, increases the urinary excretion of lead. Succimer is not to be used for prophylaxis of lead poisoning in a lead-containing environment. In addition, the use of succimer should always be accompanied by identification and removal of the source of the lead exposure. Mechanism of action: Succimer binds with ions of lead in the blood to a water-soluble complex which is subsequently excreted by the kidneys. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antidotes. Chelating Agents"}}
