The typical value of 500\u2013700 nm can be improved to 100\u2013150 nm, which corresponds to an almost spherical focal spot with 5\u20137 times less volume than that of standard confocal microscopy.  The improvement in resolution is achieved by using two opposing objective lenses both of which focused to the same geometrical location. Also the difference in optical path length through each of the two objective lenses is carefully aligned to be minimal. By this, molecules residing in the common focal area of both objectives can be illuminated coherently from both sides and also the reflected or emitted light can be collected coherently, i.e. coherent superposition of emitted light on the detector is possible.

Moving caudally, the lateral border of the amygdala is distinguishable from the adjacent cortex based on the dark appearance of layer 2 of the piriform cortex. The medial extent is easily identified based on the dark border created by the lateral hypothalamus and diagonal domain. The dorsal border of the amygdala with the striatum is defined by the start of the striations that define the caudate/putamen. The border with the hippocampus is equally straightforward due to the dark appearance of the alveus.

The axial hindbrain can be easily segmented on coronal or sagittal T2-weighted MRI, as it is comprised largely of myelinated fibers, which appear as very dark well-defined areas. The rostral protrusion of the hindbrain, the interpeduncular nucleus, appears as a light ellipse just medial to the substantia nigra. The trigeminothalamic tracts and the medial lemnisci emerge as a dark triangle just lateral to the interpeduncular nucleus. Moving caudally through the pontine nuclei the border between the midbrain and hindbrain moves dorsally as a horizontal line between the ventral-most extents of the inferior colliculi, or just above the very dark medial longitudinal fasciculus. Even further caudally this border sits just ventral to the fourth ventricle. The border between the hindbrain and cerebellum is defined mostly by the borders of the fourth ventricle. The major difficulty is in deciding how to divide the cerebellar peduncles, which traverse the cerebellum/hindbrain border. One solution is to follow a best-fit line between the vestibular nuclei medially and the cochlear nuclei laterally and use that as a dividing line between cerebellum and hindbrain.

It is a form of dystonia, a movement disorder in which muscle contractions cause sustained eyelid closure, twitching or repetitive movements. BEB begins gradually with increased frequency of eye blinking often associated with eye irritation. Other symptoms may include involuntary winking or squinting of one or both eyes, increasing difficulty in keeping the eyes open, and light sensitivity. Generally, the spasms occur during the day, disappear in sleep, and reappear after waking. As the condition progresses, the spasms may intensify, forcing the eyelids to remain closed for long periods of time, and thereby causing substantial visual disturbance or functional blindness.

This WG is working closely with researchers at UC Irvine, Columbia, Duke, MIT, MRN and INCF on these goals:-Develop provenance and derived data extraction scripts for common neuroimaging analysis software and pipelines-Extend tools and specifications for international community requirements-Create/curate an initial neuroimaging terminology and ontology for derived data and common neuroimaging concepts-Augment/improve derived data import and query functionality for multi-site derived data federationsNeuroimaging data often involves many aspects of image and signal processing on the raw data which takes considerable time and expertise.  Making such derived data available in a structured and well documented way is of interest to the international neuroimaging community.  The availability of large multi-site datasets such as the Function BIRN schizophrenia datasets and the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project data provides researchers with well-documented and structured raw data.  The addition of a similarly well-documented and structured form for derived data is the focus of this working group.  Although the Function BIRN had made strides in developing the XCEDE XML schema for the structured storage and interchange of neuroimaging derived data, being able to extract both the derived results and the provenance of what happened to the data during the analytical manipulations directly from the software and pipelines performing the computations is missing.  Without this piece, documenting derived data provenance and results becomes a burden on the researchers who are more interested in addressing scientific hypotheses than in documenting who the result was obtained for other users.To address the needs for providing derived data to the public community we have formed the derived data working group. This group brings together researchers with extensive experience with neuroimaging studies and specifically with large-scale data analysis and management using the more prevalent software packages in the field, e.g. SPM and FSL. This working group leverages the experience of the group both within BIRN and in communication with other researchers through the INCF to identify information needed for a provenance description to be useful. Face-to-face meetings to discuss needs and possible approaches were held in 2011 and 2012 at UC Irvine in January, at OHBM in June 2011, at the INCF Standards for Data Sharing task force meeting in September, and a fourth meeting in November at the annual meeting for the Society for Neuroscience.Once these details are established and there is consensus among the community, we will address the format for which this information will be stored. Initially we are focusing on XML schemas that integrate with the existing XCEDE XML schema (W3C Prov model) which describes neuroimaging data sets in general.  After identifying the needed pieces of information and their storage format we will both work with the developers of the software packages to integrate the provenance schemas into their distributions or where not possible, write scripts to extract the information. All products of the derived data group are open-source and freely available to the community through the BIRN public wiki and INCF GitHub repositories.

Through this branching, a given mossy fiber can innervate several folia.  Mossy fibers synapse on granule cells.  The synaptic contacts are made at enlargements along the length of the mossy fiber called mossy fiber rosettes.  The enlargements of the rosettes give the axons as \"mossy\" appearance in Golgi stained preparations. (adapted from Shepherd, G. M.  The synaptic organization of the brain, 5th ed.

Half of Craig's patients come from outside of Colorado, and in 2010 the hospital treated patients from 48 states and several foreign countries. At any given time, the staff at Craig treat approximately 50-55 inpatients with spinal cord injury, 25-30 with traumatic brain injury, and 50-60 outpatients. Craig provides housing for out-of-state families and outpatients, including the first 30 days free for families of new inpatients.Craig Hospital is designated by the National Institute on Disability Rehabilitation and Research (NIDRR) as a Model System Center for both spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury. Craig is also the NIDRR National Statistical TBI database for the other model system centers (2006-2011). Craig has been ranked in the top Ten Rehabilitation Hospitals in the nation for 22 consecutive years by U.S. and World Report since the rankings began in 1990. Craig has a remarkable atmosphere and culture that is casual but professional, active and upbeat.Because of Craig's expertise and specialization, large patient peer group, treatment philosophies, longevity of staff, state-of-the-art facilities and equipment, cutting edge research, family-friendly atmosphere, and the climate of Colorado, the staff at Craig believe they offer the finest rehabilitation programs anywhere, and are proud of what their patient graduates have been able to accomplish in their lives following injury. The hospital's large research department has been conducting spinal cord injury and brain injury research for decades, and along with clinicians have published textbooks and numerous articles that are recognized as key resources in the medical and rehabilitation literature. More recently Craig's Center for Spinal Cord Injury and Traumatic Brain Injury Research has begun pioneering cutting edge neuroscience research toward restorative therapies for central nervous system injuries. Craig is collaborating with the Karolinska Institute in Sweden on stem cell research in animals. Several other medication trials are also underway."}},{"Cranial_relay_neuron":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Neuron","Id":"nlx_152084","Species":"Vertebrata"}},{"Cranial_Thermal_Index":{"ValueRepresentation":"DS","RelatedTo":"BIRN-INCF Derived Data Project","DICOMID":"DICOM:0018_5026","Comment":"general term","SuperCategory":"DICOM term","Id":"nlx_149795","Has role":"Imaging protocol attribute","Is part of":"Resource:DICOM standard","Value_Representation":"DS","Definition":"The Cranial Thermal Index (TIC) measures the largest possible temperature increase in cranial bone.

Cre recombinase is a widely used tool in the field of molecular biology. The enzyme's unique and specific recombination system is exploited to manipulate genes and chromosomes in a huge range of research, such as gene knock out or knock in studies.

Further caudally the lateral border is defined by a thin sliver of lateral ventricle and the dark appearing fimbria. The caudal border of the diencephalon with the midbrain is the most difficult part of this segmentation. Moving caudally, the midbrain begins to define the ventral border of the diencephalon just as the substantia nigra (light on T2) comes in to view. Slightly more caudal, at roughly the caudal-most extent of the mammillary bodies, the slightly brighter superior colliculus emerges as the dorsal border of the diencephalon. Still further caudal the dorsal and ventral parts of the midbrain move closer together as the diencephalon disappears.

(Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Eletriptan is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D receptor agonist. In the anesthetized dog, eletriptan has been shown to reduce carotid arterial blood flow, with only a small increase in arterial blood pressure at high doses. While the effect on blood flow was selective for the carotid arterial bed, decreases in coronary artery diameter were observed. Eletriptan has also been shown to inhibit trigeminal nerve activity in the rat. Mechanism of action: Eletriptan binds with high affinity to 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D and 5-HT1F receptors, has modest affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT1E, 5-HT2B and 5-HT7 receptors, and little or no affinity for 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5A and 5-HT6 receptors. Eletriptan has no significant affinity or pharmacological activity at adrenergic alpha1, alpha2, or beta; dopaminergic D1 or D2; muscarinic; or opioid receptors. Two theories have been proposed to explain the efficacy of 5-HT receptor agonists in migraine. One theory suggests that activation of 5-HT1 receptors located on intracranial blood vessels, including those on the arteriovenous anastomoses, leads to vasoconstriction, which is correlated with the relief of migraine headache. The other hypothesis suggests that activation of 5-HT1 receptors on sensory nerve endings in the trigeminal system results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release.

The test setting consists of a plus-shaped apparatus with two open and two enclosed arms, each with an open roof, elevated 40\u201370 cm from the floor. The model is based on rodents' aversion of open spaces. This aversion leads to the behavior termed thigmotaxis, which involves avoidance of open areas by confining movements to enclosed spaces or to the edges of a bounded space. In EPM this translates into a restriction of movement to the enclosed arms.Anxiety reduction in the plus-maze is indicated by an increase in the proportion of time spent in the open arms (time in open arms/total time in open or closed arms), and an increase in the proportion of entries into the open arms (entries into open arms/total entries into open or closed arms). Total number of arm entries and number of closed-arm entries are usually employed as measures of general activity.

In most places, the border between the isocortex and the rest of the forebrain is defined by a collection of white matter bundles, which have a very different appearance under most MRI contrasts. The border between the isocortex and other parts of the cortex (olfactory cortex, amygdala etc.) is somewhat more difficult. Rostrally, the isocortex and olfactory cortex are divided by the thin rostral extent of the lateral olfactory tract, which appears much darker on T2 MRI. A horizontal line connecting the two rhinal fissures that is slightly convex towards the dorsal surface of brain approximates the dividing line between these two regions of cortex as far caudal as the mamillary bodies. Caudal to the mamillary bodies the dividing line between isocortex and piriform cortex can be defined based on the dorsal extent of later 2 of the piriform cortex, which appears quite dark (high diffusivity) of diffusion-weighted images. At roughly the caudal extent of the amygdala (the posteromedial cortical amygdaloid nucleus) the piriform cortex disappears abruptly giving way to the entorhinal cortex, which we have included in the isocortex. Further caudal, the isocortex is free-floating on all sides, and is only interrupted in its center by the caudal corpus callosum and subiculum, which tend to have a dark border on T2 MRI that contrasts nicely with the pale-appearing cortex."}},{"Isocortex_of_PHT00":{"Synonym":"isocortex","CurationStatus":"uncurated","ISBN":"123582555","Curator":"CoCoMac{{PONS brain region","Authors":["George Paxinos","Xu-Feng Huang"],"Title":"The Rhesus Monkey Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates","Abbrev":"IsoCtx","PartiallyOverlapsWith":["neocortex"],"PublicationDate":"2000","SuperCategory":"PHT00 macaque brain parcel","Id":"nlx_br_931","Is part of":"Cortex of PHT00","ParcellationScheme":["Paxinos"],"Species":"Macaque","DefiningCitation":"ISBN 0123582555"}},{"Isometric_force":{"Created":"4/27/2011 14:07","CurationStatus":"uncurated","Contributor":"Brenda Gregory","CAO_Id":"CAO_00753","Cognitive_Atlas_Link":"http://www.cognitiveatlas.org/concept/Isometric_force","SuperCategory":"Behavioral Experimental Paradigm","Id":"nlx_145975","Definition":"Subjects use their hands or fingers to apply isometric force or complete a precision grip task."}},{"Isotope_Number":{"RelatedTo":"BIRN-INCF Derived Data Project","DICOMID":"DICOM:0020_0014","SuperCategory":"DICOM term","Id":"nlx_150206","Has role":"Imaging hardware attribute","Is part of":"Resource:DICOM standard","Value_Representation":"IS","Definition":"TBD (retired)."}},{"Issuer_of_Admission_ID":{"RelatedTo":"BIRN-INCF Derived Data Project","DICOMID":"DICOM:0038_0011","Comment":"general term","SuperCategory":"DICOM term","Id":"nlx_150209","Has role":"Scan-related personnel attribute","Is part of":"Resource:DICOM standard","Value_Representation":"LO","Definition":"Name of healthcare provider who issued the Admission ID."}},{"Issuer_of_Patient_ID":{"RelatedTo":"BIRN-INCF Derived Data Project","DICOMID":"DICOM:0010_0021","SuperCategory":"DICOM term","Id":"nlx_150210","Has role":"Scan-related personnel attribute","Is part of":"Resource:DICOM standard","Value_Representation":"LO","Definition":"Identifier of the Assigning Authority (system, organization, agency, or department) that issued the Patient ID.

It is one of a group of disorders called spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Onset of the disease is usually between the ages of 20 and 40, although it has been diagnosed in men from their teens to their 70s. Early symptoms include tremor of the outstretched hands, muscle cramps with exertion, and fasciculations (fleeting muscle twitches visible under the skin). Eventually, individuals develop limb weakness which usually begins in the pelvic or shoulder regions. Weakness of the facial and tongue muscles may occur later in the course of the disease and often leads to dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), dysarthria (slurring of speech), and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Some individuals develop gynecomastia (excessive enlargement of male breasts) and low sperm count or infertility. Still others develop non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.  Kennedy's disease is an x-linked recessive disease, which means the patient's mother carries the defective gene on one of her X chromosomes. Daughters of patients with Kennedy's disease are also carriers and have a 1 in 2 chance of having a son affected with the disease. Parents with concerns about their children may wish to talk to a genetic counselor.

The emerging oculomotor nerve\u2013a dark streak on T2\u2013is one of the best markers of the ventral midbrain. Further caudally, at roughly the caudal-most extent of the mammillary bodies, the slightly brighter superior colliculus emerges at the dorsal border of the diencephalon. Still further caudal the dorsal and ventral parts of the midbrain move closer together as the diencephalon disappears. Finally, near the caudal border of the substantia nigra all that remains of the diencephalon is a light appearing protrusion from the midbrain medially in to the hippocampus laterally (the geniculate nuclei). The dorsal border between the midbrain and hippocampus/retrosplenial cortex is clearly defined by a small thin potential space that can appear as a light or dark line depending on the presence or absence of water in the space. The ventral border with hindbrain is comparably simple. Moving caudally through the pontine nuclei the border between the midbrain and hindbrain moves dorsally as a horizontal line between the ventral-most extents of the inferior colliculi, or just above the very dark medial longitudinal fasciculus. Even further caudally this border sits just ventral to the fourth ventricle.

Rationale: There is a large body of interaction data, mostly produced by high throughput systems, that does not satisfy the level of detail required to model them with ComplexAssembly class. Specifically, what is lacking is the stoichiometric information and completeness ( closed-world) of participants required to model them as chemical processes. Nevertheless interaction data is extremely useful and can be captured in BioPAX using this class. Usage: This class should be used by default for representing molecular interactions, such as those defined by PSI-MI level 2.5. The participants in a molecular interaction should be listed in the PARTICIPANTS slot. Note that this is one of the few cases in which the PARTICPANT slot should be directly populated with instances (see comments on the PARTICPANTS property in the interaction class description). If all participants are known with exact stoichiometry, ComplexAssembly class should be used instead. Example: Two proteins observed to interact in a yeast-two-hybrid experiment where there is not enough experimental evidence to suggest that the proteins are forming a complex by themselves without any indirect involvement of other proteins. This is the case for most large-scale yeast two-hybrid screens.

This idea was first proposed in 1892 by Santiago Ramรณn y Cajal the proposer of the neuron doctrine though the idea was largely neglected for the next fifty years. The first person to use the term neural plasticity appears to have been the Polish neuroscientist Jerzy Konorski.The brain consists of nerve cells or neurons (and glial cells) which are interconnected, and learning may happen through changing of the strength of the connections between neurons, by adding or removing connections, or by adding new cells. \"Plasticity\" relates to learning by adding or removing connections, or adding cells. During the 20th century, the consensus was that lower brain and neocortical areas were immutable in structure after childhood, meaning learning only happens by changing of connection strength, whereas areas related to memory formation, such as the hippocampus and dentate gyrus, where new neurons continue to be produced into adulthood, were highly plastic. This belief is being challenged by new findings, suggesting all areas of the brain are plastic even after childhood. Hubel and Wiesel had demonstrated that ocular dominance columns in the lowest neocortical visual area, V1, were largely immutable after the critical period in development. Critical periods also were studied with respect to language; the resulting data suggested that sensory pathways were fixed after the critical period. However, studies determined that environmental changes could alter behavior and cognition by modifying connections between existing neurons and via neurogenesis in the hippocampus and other parts of the brain, including the cerebellum. - definition adapted from Wikipedia"}},{"NeuroSearch":{"Synonym":"NeuroSearch A/S","Related disease":["Huntington's disease"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","Availability":"Comapny is exploring the possibilities of a controlled disposal of its remaining assets.","SuperCategory":"Commercial Organization","Id":"nlx_158521","DefiningCitation":"http://neurosearch.com/","Abbrev":"NEUR","Definition":"Commercial organization focused on research and development activities on bringing drug candidates to market, primarily in the central nervous system (CNS) segment.

It is a protein growth factor which has activity on certain neurons of the peripheral and central nervous system; it helps to support the survival and differentiation of existing neurons, and encourages the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses. NT-3 was the third neurotrophic factor to be characterized, after NGF and BDNF.Although the vast majority of neurons in the mammalian brain are formed prenatally, parts of the adult brain retain the ability to grow new neurons from neural stem cells; a process known as neurogenesis. Neurotrophins are chemicals that help to stimulate and control neurogenesis. NT-3 is unique in the number of neurons it can potentially stimulate, given its ability to activate two of the receptor tyrosine kinase neurotrophin receptors (TrkC and TrkB - see below). Mice born without the ability to make NT-3 have loss of proprioceptive and subsets of mechanoreceptive sensory neurons."}},{"NT-proBNP":{"RelatedTo":["preproBNP","proBNP"],"Synonym":"N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Protein","Id":"414798009","Is part of":"NPPB","DefinitionPMID":"18243856","Definition":"Biologically inert 76-amino acid amino-terminal portion of proBNP"}},{"NTP_Source_Address":{"RelatedTo":"BIRN-INCF Derived Data Project","DICOMID":"DICOM:0018_1803","SuperCategory":"DICOM term","Id":"nlx_150339","Has role":"DICOM administration attribute","Is part of":"Resource:DICOM standard","Value_Representation":"LO","Definition":"IP Address of NTP time source.

Originally developed as a test of emotionality by Calvin Hall (1932). The open field is an arena with walls to prevent escape. Commonly, the field is marked with a grid, and square crossings, rearing, and time spent moving are used to assess the activity of the rodent. In the modern open field apparatus, infrared beams or video cameras with associated software can be used to automate the assessment process. The OFT is also often used to assess anxiety by including additional measures of defecation, time spent in the center of the field, and the first few minutes of activity. The relation between the OFT and other tests of exploratory activity (elevated plus maze and emergence) have been analyzed in two mouse strains. Changes in these measures are often used to assess the sedative or stimulant effects of pharmacological agents (adapted from Wikipedia:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Field_(animal_test%))."}},{"Open_Government_Licence":{"RelatedTo":["Creative Commons Attribution License"],"Synonym":"Open Government License","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Open-source license","Id":"nlx_158451","Is part of":"National Archives","DefiningCitation":"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/","Abbrev":"OGL","Definition":"A copyright licence for Crown Copyright works published by the UK government.

(NCI Thesaurus)<BR>Blood plasma is the straw-colored liquid component of blood in which the blood cells in whole blood are normally suspended. It makes up about 55% of the total blood volume. It is the intravascular fluid part of extracellular fluid (all body fluid outside of cells). It is mostly water (93% by volume) and contains dissolved proteins, glucose, clotting factors, mineral ions, hormones and carbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation). Plasma also serves as the protein reserve of the human body. It plays a vital role in intravascular osmotic effect that keeps electrolyte in balance form and protects the body from infection and other blood disorders.(Wikipedia)"}},{"Plexon":{"Synonym":"Plexon Inc.","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Commercial Organization","Id":"nlx_158486","DefiningCitation":"http://www.plexon.com/"}},{"Pneumatic_Pump":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","Comment":"Adapted from WPI http://www.wpiinc.com/index.php/Virtue-Mart/vmchk.html","SuperCategory":"Pump","Id":"nlx_137398","Has role":"Instrument role","Definition":"Used for repeatable microinjection in volumes ranging from picoliters to nanoliters.

The rostral extent of the preoptic area begins just caudal to the vertical limb of the diagonal band, which is quite dark (high diffusivity) compared to the preoptic area. Moving caudally, the preoptic area is bounded dorsally by the septum. A horizontal line connecting the ventral extent of the anterior limbs of the anterior commissure roughly approximates this border. Laterally, the preoptic area is bounded by the ventral pallidum and diagonal band, which both appear significantly darker on DWI. Further caudal, the lateral border is shared with the amygdala, which is slightly darker on DWI. The ventral border between the very dark preoptic area and the optic chiasm is straightforward. The caudal border between the preoptic area and the hypothalamus is not well defined. Our solution is to create an arbitrary plane dividing the two just caudal to the optic chiasm, or at roughly the level of the vertical descent of the fornix in to the hypothalamus."}},{"Preparasubthalamic_nucleus_of_ABA_2009":{"PartiallyOverlapsWith":"Preparasubthalamic nucleus","SuperCategory":"ABA 2009 mouse brain parcel","Id":"nlx_153381","ParcellationScheme":"ABA 2009 adult mouse brain parcellation scheme","Organism":"mouse"}},{"Prepositus_nucleus_of_PHT00":{"Synonym":"prepositus nucleus","CurationStatus":"uncurated","ISBN":"123582555","Curator":"CoCoMac{{PONS brain region","Authors":["George Paxinos","Xu-Feng Huang"],"Title":"The Rhesus Monkey Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates","Abbrev":"Pr","PartiallyOverlapsWith":"Nucleus prepositus","PublicationDate":"2000","SuperCategory":"PHT00 macaque brain parcel","Id":"nlx_br_686","ParcellationScheme":["Paxinos"],"Species":"Macaque","DefiningCitation":"ISBN 0123582555"}},{"Prepubescent_human":{"Synonym":"Human prepubescent","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Human","Id":"nlx_organ_109058","Definition":"A human between the stages of birth and puberty, generally between 0 and 13 years old."}},{"Prepubesecent_chimpanzee":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Chimpanzee","Id":"nlx_organ_109087","Definition":"A chimpanzee at the age immediately before puberty, generally between 8 to 9 years old."}},{"Prescription_Description":{"RelatedTo":"BIRN-INCF Derived Data Project","DICOMID":"DICOM:300A_000E","SuperCategory":"DICOM term","Id":"nlx_150574","Has role":"Imaging procedure attribute","Is part of":"Resource:DICOM standard","Value_Representation":"ST","Definition":"User-defined description of treatment prescription."}},{"Presentation_Creation_Date":{"RelatedTo":"BIRN-INCF Derived Data Project","DICOMID":"DICOM:0070_0082","SuperCategory":"DICOM term","Id":"nlx_150575","Has role":"Processed image attribute","Is part of":"Resource:DICOM standard","Value_Representation":"DA","Definition":"Date on which this presentation was created.

They are characterized by the ability to renew themselves through mitotic cell division and differentiating into a diverse range of specialized cell types. Research in the stem cell field grew out of findings by Canadian scientists Ernest A. McCulloch and James E. Till in the 1960s. The two broad types of mammalian stem cells are: embryonic stem cells that are isolated from the inner cell mass of blastocysts, and adult stem cells that are found in adult tissues. In a developing embryo, stem cells can differentiate into all of the specialized embryonic tissues. In adult organisms, stem cells and progenitor cells act as a repair system for the body, replenishing specialized cells, but also maintain the normal turnover of regenerative organs, such as blood, skin or intestinal tissues. - adapted from Wikipedia"}},{"Stereotaxic_Instrument":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","Comment":"Adapted from WPI http://www.wpiinc.com/index.php/Virtue-Mart/vmchk.html","SuperCategory":"Physiology Instrument","Id":"nlx_152773","Has role":"Instrument role","Definition":"Stabilizes experimental subjects.

Rostrally, the striatum emerges from the center of darker forceps minor of the corpus callosum as a light, speckled patch. The ventral border between the caudate/putamen and the accumbens can be identified based on the end of the dark striations that define the caudate/putamen. Further caudal, the ventral border between the amygdala and striatum is similarly easy to identify based on the end of the dark striations. The medial border with the pallidum is subtle and may be indistinguishable on T2 MRI. On DWI, the pallidum is somewhat darker than the caudate/putamen and is more densely striated. By narrowing the contrast window, this difference can be accentuated enough to make the border apparent. At its caudal extent, the striatum is a small triangular region bounded laterally by the darker external capsule, medially by the darker internal capsule and fimbria, and ventrally by the much brighter and non-striated amygdala."}},{"Striatum_ventral_region_of_ABA_2009":{"PartiallyOverlapsWith":"Striatum ventral region","SuperCategory":"ABA 2009 mouse brain parcel","Id":"nlx_153154","ParcellationScheme":"ABA 2009 adult mouse brain parcellation scheme","Organism":"mouse"}},{"Stria_medullaris_of_the_thalamus_of_PHT00":{"Synonym":"stria medullaris of the thalamus","CurationStatus":"graph position temporary","ISBN":"123582555","Curator":"CoCoMac{{PONS brain region","Authors":["George Paxinos","Xu-Feng Huang"],"Title":"The Rhesus Monkey Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates","Abbrev":"sm","EditorialNote":"I don't see this in the Scalable Brain atlas and don't know how the hierarchy was generated.

Two visual areas ('LOC' and 'LOP') are included within this V4d topologue based on retinotopic fMRI data.  The retinotopy in the human V4d topologue differed from previous reports in macaque V4d in that it was crude or nonexistent except for an overall bias for either central or peripheral stimuli in LOC and LOP respectively. Unlike some previous reports in macaque V4d, the human V4d topologue was not significantly color-selective. However, the V4d topologue did respond selectively to kinetic motion boundaries, consistent with previous human fMRI reports. Because striking differences were found between the retinotopy and functional properties of the human topologues of 'V4v' and 'V4d', it is unlikely that these two cortical regions are subdivisions of a singular human area 'V4' (adapted from Tootell and Hadjikhani 2001).","DefinitionPMID":"11278193"}},{"Vandenberg_and_kuse_tasks":{"Created":"11/9/2009 14:44","CurationStatus":"uncurated","Contributor":"Christian Battista","CAO_Id":"CAO_00706","Cognitive_Atlas_Link":"http://www.cognitiveatlas.org/concept/Vandenberg_and_kuse_tasks","SuperCategory":"Behavioral Experimental Paradigm","Id":"nlx_145922","Definition":"Paper and pencil Test of mental rotation ability.
