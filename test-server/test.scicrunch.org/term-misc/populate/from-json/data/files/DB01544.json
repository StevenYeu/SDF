Some reports indicate that it is used as a date rape drug and suggest that it may precipitate violent behavior. The United States Government has banned the importation of this drug. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Flunitrazepam is a powerful hypnotic drug that is a benzodiazepine derivative. It has powerful hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. The drug is sometimes used as a date rape drug. In the United States, the drug has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for medical use, and is considered to be an illegal drug. It has however been approved in the United Kingdom and other countries. Mechanism of action: Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to benzodiazepine receptors BNZ1, which mediates sleep, and BNZ2, which affects affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell. Drug type: Approved. Illicit. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-anxiety Agents. Benzodiazepines. GABA Modulators. Hypnotics and Sedatives"}}
