{"S129D Alpha-Synuclein Drosophila":{"PMID":"15834418","CurationStatus":"uncurated","Pages":"657-663","PublicationDate":"April 17 2005","JournalVolume":"8","PublicationName":"Nature Neuroscience","Id":"nlx_organ_090804","JournalNumber":"5","Authors":"Li Chen and Mel B Feany","Title":"Alpha-Synuclein Phosphorylation controls neurotoxicity and inclusion formation in a Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease","Figure":"2,3","Definition":"This transgenic drosophila bears alpha-synuclein with a mutation at serine 129, which is where phosphorylation takes place.  This mutation is created by replacing a serine codon with a codon for an acidic aspartate residue, which mimics phosphorylation.  This causes increased and more rapid neurodegeneration."}}
