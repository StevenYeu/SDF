It can be used to treat bronchitis, ear infections, skin infections, and other bacterial infections. Pharmacology: Cefprozil, a semisynthetic, second-generation cephalosporin, is used to treat otitis media, soft-tissue infections, and respiratory tract infections. Mechanism of action: Cefprozil, like the penicillins, is a beta-lactam antibiotic. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, it inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that cefprozil interferes with an autolysin inhibitor. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents. Cephalosporins"}}
