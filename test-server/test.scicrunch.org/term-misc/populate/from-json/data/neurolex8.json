Norgestimate is used with estradiol to treat the symptoms of menopause. Pharmacology: Norgestimate is used as a female contraceptive. Norgestimate is a progestin or a synthetic form of the naturally occurring female sex hormone, progesterone. In a woman's normal menstrual cycle, an egg matures and is released from the ovaries (ovulation). The ovary then produces progesterone, preventing the release of further eggs and priming the lining of the womb for a possible pregnancy. If pregnancy occurs, progesterone levels in the body remain high, maintaining the womb lining. If pregnancy does not occur, progesterone levels in the body fall, resulting in a menstrual period. Norgestimate tricks the body processes into thinking that ovulation has already occurred, by maintaining high levels of the synthetic progesterone. This prevents the release of eggs from the ovaries. Mechanism of action: Norgestimate binds to androgen and progestogen receptors. Target cells include the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary.

Aminocoumarins are very potent inhibitors of bacterial DNA gyrase and work by targeting the GyrB subunit of the enzyme involved in energy tranduction. Novobiocin as well as the other aminocoumarin antibiotics act as competitive inhibitors of the ATPase reaction catalysed by GyrB. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule.

It is a protein growth factor which has activity on certain neurons of the peripheral and central nervous system; it helps to support the survival and differentiation of existing neurons, and encourages the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses. NT-3 was the third neurotrophic factor to be characterized, after NGF and BDNF.Although the vast majority of neurons in the mammalian brain are formed prenatally, parts of the adult brain retain the ability to grow new neurons from neural stem cells; a process known as neurogenesis. Neurotrophins are chemicals that help to stimulate and control neurogenesis. NT-3 is unique in the number of neurons it can potentially stimulate, given its ability to activate two of the receptor tyrosine kinase neurotrophin receptors (TrkC and TrkB - see below). Mice born without the ability to make NT-3 have loss of proprioceptive and subsets of mechanoreceptive sensory neurons."}},{"NT-proBNP":{"RelatedTo":["preproBNP","proBNP"],"Synonym":"N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Protein","Id":"414798009","Is part of":"NPPB","DefinitionPMID":"18243856","Definition":"Biologically inert 76-amino acid amino-terminal portion of proBNP"}},{"NTP Source Address":{"RelatedTo":"BIRN-INCF Derived Data Project","DICOMID":"DICOM:0018_1803","SuperCategory":"DICOM term","Id":"nlx_150339","Has role":"DICOM administration attribute","Is part of":"Resource:DICOM standard","Value_Representation":"LO","Definition":"IP Address of NTP time source.

It is considered a relatively safe drug for treating oral or gastrointestinal fungal infections. Pharmacology: Nystatin is an antibiotic which is both fungistatic and fungicidal in vitro against a wide variety of yeasts and yeast-like fungi, including Candida albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. guilliermondi, C. pseudotropicalis, C. krusei, Torulopsis glabrata, Tricophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes. Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of susceptible species resulting in a change in membrane permeability and the subsequent leakage of intracellular components. On repeated subculturing with increasing levels of nystatin, Candida albicans does not develop resistance to nystatin. Generally, resistance to nystatin does not develop during therapy. However, other species of Candida (C. tropicalis, C. guilliermondi, C. krusei, and C. stellatoides) become quite resistant on treatment with nystatin and simultaneously become cross resistant to amphotericin as well. This resistance is lost when the antibiotic is removed. Nystatin exhibits no appreciable activity against bacteria, protozoa, or viruses. Mechanism of action: Nystatin interacts with 14- demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme necessary for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. This results in inhibition of ergosterol synthesis and increased fungal cellular permeability. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents. Antifungal Agents.

Pharmacology: Octreotide exerts pharmacologic actions similar to the natural hormone, somatostatin. It is an even more potent inhibitor of growth hormone, glucagon, and insulin than somatostatin. Like somatostatin, it also suppresses leuteinizing hormone (LH) response to GnRH, decreases splanchnic blood flow, and inhibits release of serotonin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, secretin, motilin, and pancreatic polypeptide. Octreotide has been used to treat the symptoms associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors (flushing and diarrhea), and Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) secreting adenomas (watery diarrhea). Octreotide substantially reduces and in many cases can normalize growth hormone and/or IGF-1 (somatomedin C) levels in patients with acromegaly. Mechanism of action: Octreotide binds to somatostatin receptors. These receptors are coupled via pertussis toxin sensitive G proteins which lead to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Octreotide binding to these receptors also stimulates phosphotyrosine phosphatase and activation of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger via pertussis toxin insensitive G proteins. Drug type: Approved. Biotech.

Olanzapine is manufactured and marketed by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Company, whose patent for olanzapine proper ends in 2011. Pharmacology: Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic agent, is used to treat both negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia, acute mania with bipolar disorder, agitation, and psychotic symptoms in dementia. Future uses may include the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and severe behavioral disorders in autism. Structurally and pharmacologically similar to clozapine, olanzapine binds to alpha(1), dopamine, histamine H1, muscarinic, and serotonin type 2 (5-HT2) receptors. Mechanism of action: Olanzapine is an antagonist at types 1, 2, and 4 dopamine receptors, 5-HT receptor types 2A and 2C, muscarinic receptors 1 through 5, alpha(1)-receptors, and histamine H1-receptors. Olanzapine's antipsychotic effect is due to antagonism at dopamine and serotonin type 2 receptors, with greater activity at serotonin 5-HT2 receptors than at dopamine type-2 receptors. This may explain the lack of extrapyramidal effects. Olanzapine does not appear to block dopamine within the tubero-infundibular tract, explaining the lower incidence of hyperprolactinemia than with typical antipsychotic agents or risperidone.

It is marketed worldwide by Daiichi Sankyo, Ltd. and in the United States by Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. and Forest Laboratories. Pharmacology: Olmesartan, a specific angiotensin II type 1 antagonist, is used alone or with other antihypertensive agents to treat hypertension. Unlike the angiotensin receptor antagonist losartan, olmesartan does not have an active metabolite or possess uricosuric effects. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure. Mechanism of action: Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.

Olsalazine is a derivative of salicylic acid. Inactive by itself (it is a prodrug), it is converted by the bacteria in the colon to mesalamine. Mesalamine works as an anti-inflammatory agent in treating inflammatory diseases of the intestines. Pharmacology: Olsalazine is an anti-inflammatory drug used in the treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Olsalazine reduces the bowel inflammation, diarrhea (stool frequency), rectal bleeding, and abdominal pain. Like Balsalazide, Olsalazine is believed to deliver Mesalazine, or 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), past the small intestine, directly to the large intestine, which is that active site of disease in ulcerative colitis. Mechanism of action: Orally administered olsalazine is converted to mesalamine which is thought to be the therapeutically active agent in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. The mechanism of action of mesalamine (and sulfasalazine) is unknown, but appears to be topical rather than systemic. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes (LTs) and hydroxyelcosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin (PG) production in the colon.

(PubChem) Pharmacology: Omeprazole is a compound that inhibits gastric acid secretion and is indicated in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the healing of erosive esophagitis, and H. pylori eradication to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. Omeprazole belongs to a new class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted benzimidazoles, that do not exhibit anticholinergic or H2 histamine antagonistic properties, but that suppress gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme system is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the gastric mucosa, omeprazole has been characterized as a gastric acid-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final step of acid production. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus. Mechanism of action: Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. By acting specifically on the proton pump, omeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule.

Ondansetron is a highly specific and selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, not shown to have activity at other known serotonin receptors and with low affinity for dopamine receptors. Mechanism of action: Ondansetron is a selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. The serotonin 5-HT3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine, and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal efferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. Therefore Ondansetron works by blocking the reception of serotonin at these 5-HT3 receptors. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-anxiety Agents. Antiemetics. Antipruritics.

Originally developed as a test of emotionality by Calvin Hall (1932). The open field is an arena with walls to prevent escape. Commonly, the field is marked with a grid, and square crossings, rearing, and time spent moving are used to assess the activity of the rodent. In the modern open field apparatus, infrared beams or video cameras with associated software can be used to automate the assessment process. The OFT is also often used to assess anxiety by including additional measures of defecation, time spent in the center of the field, and the first few minutes of activity. The relation between the OFT and other tests of exploratory activity (elevated plus maze and emergence) have been analyzed in two mouse strains. Changes in these measures are often used to assess the sedative or stimulant effects of pharmacological agents (adapted from Wikipedia:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Field_(animal_test%))."}},{"Open Government Licence":{"RelatedTo":["Creative Commons Attribution License"],"Synonym":"Open Government License","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Open-source license","Id":"nlx_158451","Is part of":"National Archives","DefiningCitation":"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/","Abbrev":"OGL","Definition":"A copyright licence for Crown Copyright works published by the UK government.

The protein has a molecular mass of approximately 19,000 daltons, and is non-glycosylated. The polypeptide is 177 amino acids in length (the natural IL-11 has 178). This alteration has not resulted in measurable differences in bioactivity either in vitro or in vivo.The primary hematopoietic activity of Neumega is stimulation of megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis. In mice and nonhuman primate studies Neumega has shown potent thrombopoietic activity in compromised hematopoiesis, including moderately to severely myelosuppressed animals. In these studies, Neumega improved platelet nadirs and accelerated platelet recoveries compared to controls.In animal studies Oprelvekin also has non-hematopoetic activities. This includes the regulation of intestinal epithelium growth (enhanced healing of gastrointestinal lesions), the inhibition of adipogenesis, the induction of acute phase protein synthesis (e.g., fibrinogen), and inhibition of macrophageal released pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pharmacology: Oprelvekin is indicated for the prevention of severe thrombocytopenia and the reduction of the need for platelet transfusions following myelosuppressive chemotherapy in adult patients with nonmyeloid malignancies who are at high risk of severe thrombocytopenia. The primary hematopoietic activity of Oprelvekin is stimulation of megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis. Oprelvekin has shown potent thrombopoietic activity in individuals with compromised hematopoiesis Mechanism of action: Oprelvekin binds to the interleukin 11 receptor which leads to a cascade of signal transduction events. IL-11 is a thrombopoietic growth factor that directly stimulates the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocyte progenitor cells and induces megakaryocyte maturation resulting in increased platelet production.

(PubChem) Pharmacology: Orciprenaline (also known as metaproterenol), a synthetic amine, is structurally and pharmacologically similar to isoproterenol. Orciprenaline is used exclusively as a bronchodilator. The pharmacologic effects of beta adrenergic agonist drugs, such as orciprenaline, are at least in part attributable to stimulation through beta adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic- 3',5'- adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP). Increased c-AMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. Mechanism of action: Orciprenaline is a moderately selective beta(2)-adrenergic agonist that stimulates receptors of the smooth muscle in the lungs, uterus, and vasculature supplying skeletal muscle, with minimal or no effect on alpha-adrenergic receptors. Intracellularly, the actions of orciprenaline are mediated by cAMP, the production of which is augmented by beta stimulation. The drug is believed to work by activating adenylate cyclase, the enzyme responsible for producing the cellular mediator cAMP. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule.

Its primary function is preventing the absorption of fats from the human diet, thereby reducing caloric intake. Orlistat works by inhibiting pancreatic lipase, an enzyme that breaks down triglycerides in the intestine. Without this enzyme, triglycerides from the diet are prevented from being hydrolyzed into absorbable free fatty acids and are excreted undigested. Pharmacology: Orlistat is a lipase inhibitor for obesity management that acts byinhibiting the absorption of dietary fats. At the recommendedtherapeutic dose of 120 mg three times a day, orlistat inhibitsdietary fat absorption by approximately 30%. It works by inhibitingpancreatic lipase, an enzyme that breaks down fat in theintestine. Without this enzyme, fat from the diet is excretedundigested, and not absorbed by the body. Because some vitamins arefat soluble, the effect of orlistat is to reduce their bodyabsorption. Therefore the drug should only be taken in conjuction withfatty meals, and a multivitamin tablet containing these vitamins (D EK and beta-carotene) should be taken once a day, at least 2 hoursbefore or after taking the drug. In the March 15, 2004 issue of CancerResearch, (1) Steven J. Kridel et al. state that orlistat may also inhibit growth of prostate cancer, and in theory may be useful in treating other cancers, by interfering with the metabolism of fats. Mechanism of action: Orlistat is a reversible inhibitor of lipases. It exerts its therapeutic activity in the lumen of the stomach and small intestine by forming a covalent bond with the active serine residue site of gastric and pancreatic lipases. The inactivated enzymes are thus unavailable to hydrolyze dietary fat in the form of triglycerides into absorbable free fatty acids and monoglycerides. As undigested triglycerides are not absorbed, the resulting caloric deficit may have a positive effect on weight control. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule.

(PubChem) Pharmacology: Orphenadrine is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomfort associated with acute painful musculoskeletal conditions. Orphenadrine is an anticholinergic with a predominantly central effect and only a weak peripheral effect. In addition, it has mild antihistaminic and local anaesthetic properties. Parkinson's syndrome is the consequence of a disturbed balance between cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia caused by a decrease in dopamine. Orphenadrine restores the physiological equilibrium and has a favourable effect on the rigidity and tremor of Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonian syndromes. The effect is somewhat less on bradykinesia. Mechanism of action: Orphenadrine binds to both histamine H1 receptors and NMDA receptors. It restores the motor disturbances induced by neuroleptics, in particular the hyperkinesia. The dopamine deficiency in the striatum increases the stimulating effects of the cholinergic system. This stimulation is counteracted by the anticholinergic effect of orphenadrine. It may have a relaxing effect on skeletal muscle spasms and it has a mood elevating effect. Drug type: Approved.

Upon a government decree, OTKA has been operating as an independent non-profit organisation since 1991. Its legal status and rules of operation were established in an act in 1993 and reinforced in 1997 by the Hungarian parliament in order to provide independent support to scientific research activities and infrastructure, to promote scientific achievements of international standards, and to provide assistance to young researchers. As an independent institution, OTKA reports to the parliament and the government of Hungary.

The name \"penicillin\" can either refer to several variants of penicillin available, or to the group of antibiotics derived from the penicillins. Oxacillin has in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of Oxacillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through Oxacillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Oxacillin is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases. Mechanism of action: By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, Oxacillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that Oxacillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule.

(PubChem) Pharmacology: Oxprenolol is a non-selective beta blocker with some intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Oxprenolol is a lipophilic beta blocker which passes the blood-brain barrier more easily than water soluble beta blockers. As such, it is associated with a higher incidence of CNS-related side effects than hydrophilic ligands such as atenolol, sotalol and nadolol. Oxprenolol is an potent beta-blocker and should not be administered to asthmatics because it can cause irreversible airway failure and inflammation. Mechanism of action: Like other beta-adrenergic antagonists, oxprenolol competes with adrenergic neurotransmitters such as catecholamines for binding at sympathetic receptor sites. Like propranolol and timolol, oxprenolol binds at beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle, inhibiting the effects of the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine and decreasing heart rate, cardiac output, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. It also blocks beta-2 adrenergic receptors located in bronchiole smooth muscle, causing vasoconstriction. By binding beta-2 receptors in the juxtaglomerular apparatus, oxprenolol inhibits the production of renin, thereby inhibiting angiotensin II and aldosterone production. Oxprenolol therefore inhibits the vasoconstriction and water retention due to angiotensin II and aldosterone, respectively. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule.

(PubChem) Pharmacology: Oxycodone, a semisynthetic opiate agonist derived from the opioid alkaloid, thebaine, is similar to other phenanthrene derivatives such as hydrocodone and morphine. Oxycodone is available in combination with aspirin or acetaminophen to control pain and restless leg and Tourette syndromes. Mechanism of action: Oxycodone acts as a weak agonist at mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors within the central nervous system (CNS). Oxycodone primarily affects mu-type opioid receptors, which are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as modulators, both positive and negative, of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids such as oxycodone also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin, and glucagon. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (kappa-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (mu and delta receptor agonist).

It stabilizes microtubules in their polymerized form leading to cell death. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Paclitaxel is a taxoid antineoplastic agent indicated as first-line and subsequent therapy for the treatment of advanced carcinoma of the ovary, and other various cancers including breast cancer. Paclitaxel is a novel antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerization. This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. In addition, paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or \"bundles\" of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis. Mechanism of action: Paclitaxel interferes with the normal function of microtubule growth. Whereas drugs like colchicine cause the depolymerization of microtubules in vivo, paclitaxel arrests their function by having the opposite effect; it hyper-stabilizes their structure. This destroys the cell's ability to use its cytoskeleton in a flexible manner. Specifically, paclitaxel binds to the  subunit of tubulin. Tubulin is the \"building block\" of mictotubules, and the binding of paclitaxel locks these building blocks in place. The resulting microtubule/paclitaxel complex does not have the ability to disassemble. This adversely affects cell function because the shortening and lengthening of microtubules (termed dynamic instability) is necessary for their function as a transportation highway for the cell. Chromosomes, for example, rely upon this property of microtubules during mitosis. Further research has indicated that paclitaxel induces programmed cell death (apoptosis) in cancer cells by binding to an apoptosis stopping protein called Bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia 2) and thus arresting its function.

It is the most effective of the 5-HT3 antagonists in controlling delayed CINV nausea and vomiting that appear more than 24 hours after the first dose of a course of chemotherapy and is the only drug of its class approved for this use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. As of 2007, it is the most recent 5-HT3 antagonist to enter clinical use. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Palonosetron is an antinauseant and antiemetic agent indicated for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately-emetogenic cancer chemotherapy and for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Palonosetron is a highly specific and selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, not shown to have activity at other known serotonin receptors and with low affinity for dopamine receptors. Mechanism of action: Palonosetron is a selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. The serotonin 5-HT3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine, and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal efferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. Therefore Palonosetron works by blocking the reception of serotonin at these 5-HT3 receptors. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antiemetics.

(Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Pamidronate is in a class of drugs called bisphosphonates. Pamidronate reduces breakdown of the bones. Pamidronate is used in the treatment of Paget's disease of bone; to reduce high levels of calcium in the blood associated with malignancy (cancer); and to reduce the breakdown of bone due to metastases of breast cancer or multiple myeloma. Mechanism of action: The mechanism of action of pamidronate is inhibition of bone resorption. Pamidronate adsorbs to calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) crystals in bone and may directly block dissolution of this mineral component of bone. In vitro studies also suggest that inhibition of osteoclast activity contributes to inhibition of bone resorption. Pamidronate also targets farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (such as pamidronate, alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate and zoledronate) appear to act as analogues of isoprenoid diphosphate lipids, thereby inhibiting FPP synthase, an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Inhibition of this enzyme in osteoclasts prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids (FPP and GGPP) that are essential for the post-translational farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of small GTPase signalling proteins. This activity inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone mass. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-inflammatory Agents.

This results in inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine and vascular growth factor production. Mechanism of action: Panitumumab binds specifically to EGFR on both normal and tumor cells, and competitively inhibits the binding of ligands for EGFR. Nonclinical studies show that binding of panitumumab to the EGFR prevents ligand-induced receptor autophosphorylation and activation of receptor-associated kinases, resulting in inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine and vascular growth factor production, and internalization of the EGFR.

It is a direct-acting smooth muscle relaxant used in the treatment of impotence and as a vasodilator, especially for cerebral vasodilation. The mechanism of its pharmacological actions is not clear, but it apparently can inhibit phosphodiesterases and it may have direct actions on calcium channels. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Papaverine is a nonxanthine phosphodiesterase inhibitor for the relief of cerebral and peripheral ischemia associated with arterial spasm and myocardial ischemia complicated by arrhythmias. The main actions of Papaverine are exerted on cardiac and smooth muscle. Like qathidine, Papaverine acts directly on the heart muscle to depress conduction and prolong the refractory period. Papaverine relaxes various smooth muscles. This relaxation may be prominent if spasm exists. The muscle cell is not paralyzed by Papaverine and still responds to drugs and other stimuli causing contraction. The antispasmodic effect is a direct one, and unrelated to muscle innervation. Papaverine is practically devoid of effects on the central nervous system. Papaverine relaxes the smooth musculature of the larger blood vessels, especially coronary, systemic peripheral, and pulmonary arteries. Mechanism of action: Perhaps by its direct vasodilating action on cerebral blood vessels, Papaverine increases cerebral blood flow and decreases cerebral vascular resistance in normal subjects; oxygen consumption is unaltered. These effects may explain the benefit reported from the drug in cerebral vascular encephalopathy. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors.

Disease causation is in fact the ultimate goal of much biomedical research, and our recognitition of ALL the driving causes of a particular disease - and the ways in which these causes inter-relate with each other and with effected structures to cause a change in normal function is a critical representational task BIRNlex will increasingly take on to provide an evolving, nuanced functional reconstruction of disease as a process and an outcome.  These relations will be represented using OWL ObjectProperties.  Function is the most sensible context to drive the asserted subsumptive hierarchy for representing nervous system disease, since it is with the clinical description of altered, impaired, decreased, or lost function that the diagnosis - and the research - of disease is rooted.  Much has already been described regarding both the effected biomaterial entities and the causes of disease.  However, it is because understanding of such relations still is far from comprehensive, that biomedical investigation into nervous system disease continues.  Finally, given the \"realist\" ontology design approach being used to construct BIRNLex, function must be represented as inhering in some biomaterial entity from molecules and their controlling elements on up through gross anatomical structures.  Over time, BIRNLex will provide the required relations to depict these functionally-related structures for both the normal and pathological function of the nervous system.  This will be true both for the causes and for the outcomes of nervous system disease.  Initial work to extend this expressive representation will focus on the neurodegenerative diseases being studied by BIRN researchers.  Though this will be te case, BIRNLex still needs to provide a core asserted hierarchy for a broad swarth of nervous system disease, so as to enable BIRN researchers to link to the breadth of disorders that may impact or relate to those directly under study.","Synonym":["Plegia"],"Created":"2007-10-05","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Nervous system disease","Id":"birnlex_12641","DefiningCitation":["Adams et al.","Principles of Neurology","6th ed"],"Definition":"Severe loss of motor function as compared with PARESIS, a slight loss; GENERAL PARALYSIS see NEUROSYPHILIS does not mean \"generalized paralysis\" ( "}},{"Paramedian lobule of ABA 2009":{"PartiallyOverlapsWith":"Paramedian lobule","SuperCategory":"ABA 2009 mouse brain parcel","Id":"nlx_153602","ParcellationScheme":"ABA 2009 adult mouse brain parcellation scheme","Organism":"mouse"}},{"Paramedian reticular nucleus":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Regional part of brain","Id":"nlx_151902","Has role":"Precerebellar nucleus","Is part of":"Medullary reticular formation"}},{"Paramedian reticular nucleus of ABA 2009":{"PartiallyOverlapsWith":"Paramedian reticular nucleus","SuperCategory":"ABA 2009 mouse brain parcel","Id":"nlx_153085","ParcellationScheme":"ABA 2009 adult mouse brain parcellation scheme","Organism":"mouse"}},{"Paramedian reticular nucleus of PHT00":{"Synonym":"paramedian reticular nucleus","CurationStatus":"uncurated","PartiallyOverlapsWith":"paramedian reticular nucleus","ISBN":"123582555","PublicationDate":"2000","SuperCategory":"PHT00 macaque brain parcel","Curator":"CoCoMac{{PONS brain region","Id":"nlx_br_610","Authors":["George Paxinos","Xu-Feng Huang"],"Species":"Macaque","Title":"The Rhesus Monkey Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates","DefiningCitation":"ISBN 0123582555","Abbrev":"PMn"}},{"Parameter Fitting":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Neural coding","Id":"oen_0001054","Has role":"Electrophysiology concept","DefiningCitation":"ModelDB:3637"}},{"Parameter sensitivity":{"EditorialNote":"determining robustness of model","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Electrophysiology concept","Id":"oen_0001053","DefiningCitation":"ModelDB:116962","Definition":"In neural modeling, refers to how model results vary as model parameters are changed."}},{"Paramethadione":{"RelatedTo":"Voltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1I","Synonym":[", Isoethadione","Paradione","Paradione (TN)","Parametadiona (INN-Spanish)","Parametadione","Parametadione (DCIT)","Paramethadione (BAN:INN)"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB00617","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00617","Definition":"Paramethadione is an anticonvulsant in the oxazolidinedione class. It is associated with fetal trimethadione syndrome, which is also known as paramethadione syndrome. Pharmacology: Paramethadione is an oxazolidinedione anticonvulsant similar to trimethadione that acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce the number of absence seizures (often seen in epileptics). Absence seizures involve an interruption to consciousness where the person experiencing the seizure seems to become vacant and unresponsive for a short period of time (usually up to 30 seconds). Paramethadione acts on thalamic neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (which studies have shown to be associated with absence seizures, von Krosigk et al., 1993). Mechanism of action: Dione anticonvulsants such as paramethadione reduce T-type calcium currents in thalamic neurons (including thalamic relay neurons). This inhibits corticothalamic transmission and raises the threshold for repetitive activity in the thalamus. This results in a dampening of the abnormal thalamocortical rhythmicity proposed to underlie the 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharge seen on electroencephalogram (EEG) during absence seizures.

It has been used by mouth in the treatment of all conditions in which corticosteroid therapy is indicated except adrenal-deficiency states for which its lack of sodium-retaining properties makes it less suitable than hydrocortisone with supplementary fludrocortisone. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p737) Pharmacology: Paramethasone is a glucocorticoid with the general properties of corticosteroids. Mechanism of action: Glucocorticoids such as paramethasone can inhibit leukocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation, interfere with mediators of inflammatory response, and suppress humoral immune responses. The antiinflammatory actions of glucocorticoids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Paramethasone reduces inflammatory reaction by limiting the capillary dilatation and permeability of the vascular structures. These compounds restrict the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages and reduce the release of vasoactive kinins. Recent research suggests that corticosteroids may inhibit the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids, thereby reducing the formation of prostaglandins. Prednisolone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. On binding, the corticoreceptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing an increase or decrease in expression of specific target genes, including suppression of IL2 (interleukin 2) expression.

Disease causation is in fact the ultimate goal of much biomedical research, and our recognitition of ALL the driving causes of a particular disease - and the ways in which these causes inter-relate with each other and with effected structures to cause a change in normal function is a critical representational task BIRNlex will increasingly take on to provide an evolving, nuanced functional reconstruction of disease as a process and an outcome.  These relations will be represented using OWL ObjectProperties.  Function is the most sensible context to drive the asserted subsumptive hierarchy for representing nervous system disease, since it is with the clinical description of altered, impaired, decreased, or lost function that the diagnosis - and the research - of disease is rooted.  Much has already been described regarding both the effected biomaterial entities and the causes of disease.  However, it is because understanding of such relations still is far from comprehensive, that biomedical investigation into nervous system disease continues.  Finally, given the \"realist\" ontology design approach being used to construct BIRNLex, function must be represented as inhering in some biomaterial entity from molecules and their controlling elements on up through gross anatomical structures.  Over time, BIRNLex will provide the required relations to depict these functionally-related structures for both the normal and pathological function of the nervous system.  This will be true both for the causes and for the outcomes of nervous system disease.  Initial work to extend this expressive representation will focus on the neurodegenerative diseases being studied by BIRN researchers.  Though this will be te case, BIRNLex still needs to provide a core asserted hierarchy for a broad swarth of nervous system disease, so as to enable BIRN researchers to link to the breadth of disorders that may impact or relate to those directly under study.","Created":"2007-11-18","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Nervous system disease","Id":"birnlex_12640","Definition":"A general term referring to a mild to moderate degree of muscular weakness, occasionally used as a synonym for PARALYSIS (severe or complete loss of motor function).

Paricalcitol has been used to reduce parathyroid hormone levels. Paricalcitol is indicated for the prevention and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with chronic renal failure. Pharmacology: Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone. The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin and from dietary intake. Vitamin D requires two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and to activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol (1,25(OH)2 D3), is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and to VDRs found in many other tissues, including prostate, endothelium and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone. In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis.1 Decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2 D3 have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2 D3 and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy. An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A at concentrations up to 50 nM (21 ng/mL). Mechanism of action: Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D analog of calcitriol with modifications to the side chain (D2) and the A (19-nor) ring. Preclinical andin vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding of the VDR, which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce parathyroid hormone levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule.
