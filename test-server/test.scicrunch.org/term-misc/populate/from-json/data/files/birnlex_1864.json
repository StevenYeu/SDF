{"Cognitive function":{"Created":"2007-03-05","EditorialNote":"The examples are derived from the Wikipedia page on 'Mental function.'  Perhaps a more narrow set of examples that specifically fit to our requirements in BIRN would be more appropriate.  A more authoritative neuropsychological source should also be used, as some of these examples may be considered by neuropsychologists to be degenerate - e.g., 'belief function' is_a 'imaginative function' (BB:2007-03-05).Note that we are distinguishing between processes and functions, so there will appear to be a set of duplicate classes.  The distinction as described by BFO, as we understand it, is that functions are end-directed activities of continuants.  So memory function is an end activity of a memory process.  We therefore measure memory function as an indicator of the effectiveness of the memory process.","CurationStatus":"uncurated","Umlscui":"C0392335","SuperCategory":"Behavioral system function","Id":"birnlex_1864"}}
