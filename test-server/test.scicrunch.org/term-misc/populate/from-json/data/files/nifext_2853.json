The BK channel consists of 4 alpha subunits and 4 optional auxiliary beta subunits. The pore-forming alpha subunit is encoded by the KCNMA1 gene, which produces multiple isoforms through alternative splicing. The 4 beta subunits are encoded by different genes that show tissue-specific expression"}}
