(PubChem) Pharmacology: Moricizine is used to treat irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) and to maintain a normal heart rate. It acts on the heart muscle to improve the heart's rhythm. Moricizine has potent local anesthetic activity and membrane stabilizing effect. Decreases excitability, conduction velocity, and automaticity as a result of slowed atrioventricular (AV) nodal and His-Purkinje conduction. Decreases the action potential duration (APD) in Purkinje fibers; also decreases the effective refractory period (ERP) but to a lesser extent than the APD, so the ERP\/APD ratio is increased. Decreases the maxiumum rate of Phase 0 depolarization (V max ), but does not affect action potential amplitude or maximum diastolic potential. Does not affect atrial, AV nodal, or left ventricular refractory periods and has minimal effect on ventricular repolarization (evidenced by the overall decrease in JT interval). Has no effect on sinoatrial (SA) nodal or intra-atrial conduction and only minimal effect on sinus cycle length and sinus node recovery time. In the Vaughan Williams classification of antiarrhythmics, moricizine is considered to be a class I agent. It has properties of class IA, IB, and IC agents but does not clearly belong to any of the three subclasses. It has less effect on the slope of phase 0 and a greater effect on action potential duration and effective refractory period than class IC agents. Mechanism of action: Moricizine works by inhibiting the rapid inward sodium current across myocardial cell membranes. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Arrhythmia Agents"}}
