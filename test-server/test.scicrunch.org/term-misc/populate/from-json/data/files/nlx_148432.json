No activation of zone C or other zones is observed (Yorozu et al."],"Id":"nlx_148432","FBBT_Link":"http:\/\/www.virtualflybrain.org\/site\/tools\/anatomy_finder\/index.htm?id","FBbt_Id":"FBbt_00100013","Definition":"Johnston's organ neuron tonically activated by posterior arista deflection and required for wind-induced suppression of locomotion behaviour (WISL, Yorozu et al., 2009). These neurons project to zone E of the antennal mechanosensory and motor center."}}
