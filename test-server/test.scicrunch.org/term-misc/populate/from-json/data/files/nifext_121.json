Each tufted cell is characterized by usually a single short primary dendrite that traverses the outer external plexiform layer and terminates within an olfactory glomerulus in a tuft of branches, where it receives the input from olfactory receptor neuron axon terminals. Differentiated from external tufted cells.  Axons of the tufted cells transfer information to a number of areas in the brain, including the piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, olfactory tubercle, and amygdala. Shepherd, Shen, Greer.
