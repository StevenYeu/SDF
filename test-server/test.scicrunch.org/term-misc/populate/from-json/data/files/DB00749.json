It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis; rheumatoid arthritis; ankylosing spondylitis; and in the alleviation of postoperative pain (pain, postoperative). (PubChem) Pharmacology: Etodolac, an antiinflammatory agent with analgesic and antipyretic properties, is used to treat osteoarthritis and control acute pain. Mechanism of action: The antiinflammatory effects of etodolac may result from the inhibition of the enzyme cycooxygenase and the subsequent peripheral inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. As prostaglandins sensitize pain receptors, their inhibition accounts for the peripheral analgesic effects of etodolac. Antipyresis may occur by central action on the hypothalamus, resulting in peripheral dilation, increased cutaneous blood flow, and subsequent heat loss. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal. Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors. Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Agents (NSAIDs)"}}
