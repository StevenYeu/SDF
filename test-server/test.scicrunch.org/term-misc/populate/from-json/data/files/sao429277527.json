Resting potential is modulated by perturbations in stereocilia located at the apical pole of the cell. In contrast to outer hair cells, the inner hair cells are fewer in number, have fewer stereocilia, and are less differentiated. They do, however, receive ~95% of the auditory-nerve dendrites.  Although a single auditory nerve fiber innervates several outer hair cells, each inner hair cell receives several more heavily myelinated, auditory-nerve dendrites.  Neurotransmitter release activates the auditory nerve, which leads to the cochlear nucleus within the central auditory pathway.(MSH)","DefinitionPMID":"18619539,3909832"}}
