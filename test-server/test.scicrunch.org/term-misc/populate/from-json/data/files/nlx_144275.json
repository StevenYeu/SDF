{"Retina Off-Midget Ganglion Cell":{"LocationOfAxonArborization":"P-Layer of Lateral Geniculate Nuclues","Synonym":["P Cell"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","FiringPatterns":"Regular spiking","SuperCategory":"Neuron","Id":"nlx_144275","Species":"Vertebrata","Definition":"Physiologically classified as the main ganglion cells with small receptive fields driven by center-off input. Matched with morphologically defined cell of extremely small dendritic arborization. As a population forms both a physical mosaic within retina as well as a receptive field mosaic of stimulus space. Both receptive field size and dendritic arborization are distinct from the corresponding On-Midget."}}
