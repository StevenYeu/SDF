Scharfman"],"Definition":"The Dentate Gyrus MOPP cell (molecular layer perforant path-associated cell) is a interneuron in hippocampal formation. It is located deep in the DG molecular layer, has a multipolar or triangular cell body and gives rise to an axon that produces a substantial terminal plexus largely limited to the outer two thirds of the DG molecular layer."}}
