It is commonly marketed under the trade name Spectracef by Cornerstone BioPharma. Pharmacology: Cefditoren pivoxil is a prodrug which is hydrolyzed by esterases during absorption, and the drug is distributed in the circulating blood as active cefditoren. Cefditoren is a cephalosporin with antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. Cefditoren is effective against Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains, including b-lactamase-producing strains), penicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae (including b-lactamase-producing strains), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (including b-lactamase-producing strains), Moraxella catarrhalis (including b-lactamase-producing strains), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus Groups C and G, and Streptococcus, viridans group (penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate strains). Mechanism of action: The bactericidal activity of cefditoren results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cefditoren is stable in the presence of a variety of b-lactamases, including penicillinases and some cephalosporinases. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents.
