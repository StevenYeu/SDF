As was shown by Welker ('71,'76), and in our own mapping studies (see Fig. 3), this discontinuous pattern of granular, or koniocortical, zones contains within itself a map of the rat's cutaneous periphery. There are clear subtypes within this cytoarchitectural subregion, notably including the \"granular aggregate\" type of cytoarchitecture characteristic of the paw, limb, and mystacial vibrissae areas, and the \"barrel-field\" type (originally described by Woolsey and Van der Loos, '70) seen in the nose and perioral regions. In the mouse, but not the rat, such barrels also cover the whole whisker representation (Welker and Woolsey, '74)."}}
