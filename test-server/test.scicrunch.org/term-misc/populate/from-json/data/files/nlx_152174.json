{"Elevated plus maze test":{"Related disease":"Anxiety","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Behavioral Experimental Paradigm","Id":"nlx_152174","Has role":"Anxiety test","Species":"Rodent","Abbrev":"EPM","Definition":"A behavioral paradigm that serves as arodent model of anxiety and is also used as a screening test for putative anxiolytic or anxiogenic compounds and as a general research tool in neurobiological anxiety research. The test setting consists of a plus-shaped apparatus with two open and two enclosed arms, each with an open roof, elevated 40\u201370 cm from the floor. The model is based on rodents' aversion of open spaces. This aversion leads to the behavior termed thigmotaxis, which involves avoidance of open areas by confining movements to enclosed spaces or to the edges of a bounded space. In EPM this translates into a restriction of movement to the enclosed arms.Anxiety reduction in the plus-maze is indicated by an increase in the proportion of time spent in the open arms (time in open arms\/total time in open or closed arms), and an increase in the proportion of entries into the open arms (entries into open arms\/total entries into open or closed arms). Total number of arm entries and number of closed-arm entries are usually employed as measures of general activity. (adapted from Wikipedia:  http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Elevated_plus_maze)"}}
