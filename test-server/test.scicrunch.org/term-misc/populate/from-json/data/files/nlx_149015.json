The axon collaterals in the brain innervate the subesophageal ganglion ipsi- and contralaterally, the tritocerebrum and fasciculate with the maxillary and labral nerve. Four axons extend along the cervical connective to the ventral nerve cord. The axons that extend along the ventral nerve cord connect to the leucokinin ABLK neurons. There are two to three pairs of neurons (de Haro et al., 2010).","Fasciculates_with":["adult labral nerve","cervical connective"]}}
