This receptor class has a low affinity for beta1 and beta2 receptors, but a high affinity for BRL 37344 and its derivatives. It is located mainly in adipose tissue and is involved in the regulation of lipolysis and thermogenesis. Some \u03b23 agonists have demonstrated antistress effects in animal studies, suggesting it also has a role in the CNS. Beta3-Receptors are found in the gallbladder, urinary bladder, and in brain adipose tissue. Their role in gallbladder physiology is unknown, but they are thought to play a role in lipolysis and thermogenesis in brown fat. In the urinary bladder it is thought to cause relaxation of the bladder and prevention of urination."}}
