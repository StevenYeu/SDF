(PubChem) Pharmacology: Fosfomycin is a broad spectrum antibiotic that concentrates in kidney and bladder and is used to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Fosfomycin also reduces nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of platinum-containing anti-tumor agents. Mechanism of action: Fosfomycin is a phosphoenolpyruvate analogue produced by Streptomyces that irreversibly inhibits enolpyruvate transferase (MurA), which prevents the formation of N-acetylmuramic acid, an essential element of the peptidoglycan cell wall. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents"}}
