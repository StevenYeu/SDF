It binds competitively to cholinergic receptors on the motor end-plate to antagonize the action of acetylcholine, resulting in a block of neuromuscular transmission. Pharmacology: Mivacurium is a short-acting, nondepolarizing skeletal neuromuscular blocking agent which is hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase. Mivacurium results in a blockade of neuromuscular transmission by binding competitively with cholinergic receptors on the motor end-plate to antagonize the action of acetylcholine. The neuromuscular block produced by mivacurium is readily antagonized by anticholinesterase agents. The deeper the level of neuromuscular block at reversal, the longer the time required for recovery of neuromuscular function and the greater the dose of anticholinesterase agent required. Because spontaneous recovery after mivacurium is rapid, routine reversal may not always result in a clinical benefit. Mechanism of action: Mivacurium binds competitively to cholinergic receptors on the motor end-plate to antagonize the action of acetylcholine, resulting in a block of neuromuscular transmission. This action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Neuromuscular Nondepolarizing Agents"}}
