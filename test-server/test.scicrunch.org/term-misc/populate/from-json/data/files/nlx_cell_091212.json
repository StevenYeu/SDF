The cell bodies are located within or immediately adjacent to the pyramidal cell layer and possess radially oriented dendrites spanning all layers. According to the distribution of the dendritic tree, chandelier cells are in a position to receive excitatory input from all major sources of afferents in both the CA1 and CA3 subfields."}}
