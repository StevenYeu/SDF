It is also used in the treatment for panic disorder as are a few other anticonvulsants. Though the exact mechanism by which tiagabine exerts its effect on the human body is unknown, it does appear to operate as a selective GABA reuptake inhibitor. Pharmacology: Tiagabine is used primarily as an anticonvulsant for the adjunctive treatment of epilepsy. The precise mechanism by which Tiagabine exerts its antiseizure effect is unknown, although it is believed to be related to its ability to enhance the activity of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Tiagabine binds to recognition sites associated with the GABA uptake carrier. It is thought that, by this action, Tiagabine blocks GABA uptake into presynaptic neurons, permitting more GABA to be available for receptor binding on the surfaces of post-synaptic cells. Mechanism of action: Though the exact mechanism by which Tiagabine exerts its effect on the human body is unknown, it does appear to operate as a selective GABA reuptake inhibitor. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anticonvulsants. GABA Agonists. Neuroprotective Agents. Neurotransmitter Uptake Inhibitors"}}
