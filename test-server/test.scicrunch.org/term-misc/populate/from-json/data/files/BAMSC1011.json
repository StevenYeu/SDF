Their morphology was more heterogeneous than that of Groups RGA and RGB. We classified cells with a large soma and a large dendritic field as RGA, cells with a small to  to medium to sized soma and a small to  to medium to sized dendritic field as RGB, and cells with a small to  to medium to sized soma but a medium to to to large dendritic field RGC."}}
