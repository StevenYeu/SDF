{"Laronidase":{"RelatedTo":"Iduronic acid","Synonym":["Alpha-L-iduronidase precursor"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB00090","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB00090","Definition":"Human recombinant alpha-L-iduronidase, 628 residues (mature form), produced by recombinant DNAtechnology in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line. Laronidase is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 83 kD. The predicted amino acid sequence of the recombinant form, as well as the nucleotide sequence that encodes it, are identical to a polymorphic form of human a-L-iduronidase. It contains 6 N-linked oligosaccharide modification sites. Pharmacology: Laronidase is used to treat mucopolysaccharide storage disorders (specifically mucopolysaccharidosis 1 or Hurlers syndrome) caused by deficiencies of alpha-L-iduronidase. Reduced or absent a-L-iduronidase activity results in the accumulation of the GAG substrates, dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate, throughout the body and leads to widespread cellular, tissue, and organ dysfunction. Mechanism of action: Laronidase catalyses the hydrolysis of terminal alpha-L-iduronic acid residues of dermatan sulfate and heparin sulfate. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Enzyme Replacement Agents"}}
