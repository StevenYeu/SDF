Regular use leads to tolerance, and it is usually not effective for more than 7 days. Structurally, it does not resemble the barbituates, but it shares many effects with this class of drugs; the depressant effects of ethinamate are, however, generally milder than those of most barbiturates. Pharmacology: Ethinamate is used to treat insomnia (trouble in sleeping). However, it has generally been replaced by other medicines for the treatment of insomnia. If ethinamate is used regularly (for example, every day) to help produce sleep, it is usually not effective for more than 7 days. Structurally, it does not resemble the barbiturates, but it shares many effects with this class of drugs; the depressant effects of ethinamate are, however, generally milder than those of most barbiturates. Continued and inappropriate use of ethinamate can lead to tolerance and physical dependence, with withdrawal symptoms very similar to those of the barbiturates. Mechanism of action: The mechanism of action is not known. However, studies have shown that ethinamate inhibits carbonic anhydrases I and II (J Biol Chem. 1992 Dec 15;267(35):25044-50). This inhibition by ethinamate is not sufficiently strong to implicate carbonic anhydrases I and II in the mechanism of action. Drug type: Approved. Illicit. Small Molecule. Drug category: Hypnotics and Sedatives"}}
