{"Pinceau":{"SuperCategory":"Supra Cellular Structure","Id":"sao732341560","Definition":"Supracellular structure formed by the descending axon collaterals of several cerebellar basket cells that wrap around the Purkinje cell initial segment. Although the axons contain many vesicles and form terminal endings, most do not synapse directly on the Purkinje cell initial segment but rather end blindly."}}
