{"Omalizumab":{"RelatedTo":["High affinity immunoglobulin epsilon receptor subunit alpha"],"Synonym":["Ig gamma-1 chain C region"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB00043","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB00043","Definition":"A recombinant DNA-derived humanized IgG1k monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to human immunoglobulin E (IgE). Xolair is produced by a Chinese hamster ovary cell suspension culture in a nutrient medium containing the antibiotic gentamicin. Pharmacology: Xolair inhibits the binding of IgE to the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) on the surface of mast cells and basophils. Reduction in surface-bound IgE on FceRI-bearing cells limits the degree of release of mediators of the allergic response. Xolair is used to treat severe, persisten asthma. Mechanism of action: Xolair binds to IgE (a class of antibodies normally secreted in allergic responses), which prevents their binding to mast cells and basophils. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Anti-Asthmatic Agents. Immunomodulatory Agents"}}
