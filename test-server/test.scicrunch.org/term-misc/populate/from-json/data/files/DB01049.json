Ergoloid Mesylate is the only vasodilator that has shown mild benefits in the treatment of vascular dementia. Pharmacology: Ergoloid Mesylate may increase cerebral metabolism and blood flow. The role of this medication in the therapy of dementia is controversial. A recent controlled study in patients with Alzheimer's disease found that there was no advantage to the use of ergoloid mesylates compared to placebo, suggesting that ergoloid mesylates may lower scores on some cognitive and behavioral rating scales. Further study is needed to determine the risk-benefit profile of ergoloid mesylates in the treatment of dementia. Mechanism of action: Ergoloid mesylates act centrally, decreasing vascular tone and slowing the heart rate, and acts peripherally to block alpha-receptors. One other possible mechanism is the effect of ergoloid mesylates on neuronal cell metabolism, resulting in improved oxygen uptake and cerebral metabolism, thereby normalizing depressed neurotransmitter levels. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists. Nootropic Agents. Sympatholytics. Vasodilator Agents"}}
