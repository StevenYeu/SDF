{"Behavioral activity":{"Created":"2007-03-06","EditorialNote":"This seems a bit contrived but appears to be an appropriate way to classify the sub-classes of behavioral activity derived from this class.  These certainly are dispositions inhering in the entity performing the activity.  There are also many behavioral activities where it really is a non-sequetor to call them behavioral functions - e.g., 'smoking' is certainly a behavior, but it really makes little sense to represent a 'smoking function' and underlying 'smoking process.' Describing behavior as an activity to which an entity is disposed makes it possible to represent very complex behaviors for which the corresponding behavioral function(s) and underlying process(es) are not yet characterized.  Note also that one can describe the activity without proscribing the associated function and underlying process - e.g., ants and humans can both be said to be disposed toward expressing 'locomotive behavior', and, yet, the associated 'locomotor function' and underlying 'locomotor process' in each organism is very different.  Note also that behavior in general is not restricted to organic 'living' entities but can also be expressed by 'non-living' entities such as the old 'bobbing bird' toy or an automatic loom.  Specific entities may have specific dispositions for expressing certain sets of behavioral activities (BB:2007-03-05).","Synonym":"Behavior","CurationStatus":"uncurated","Umlscui":"C0004927","SuperCategory":"Disposition","Id":"birnlex_1827","DefiningCitation":"UMLS","Definition":"Behavior; the actions or reactions of an object or organism, usually in relation to the environment or surrounding world of stimuli.
