This mutated alpha-synuclein is unable to aggregate in vitro in a transgenic Drosophila model.  There are no alpha-synclein aggregates and no loss of tyrosine hydroxylase- positive neurons.  This mutation is used to investigate the importance of alpha-synuclein aggregation on neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's Disease."}}
