{"Amygdala of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["amygdala p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151532","Is part of":"Subpallium of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"The amygdala is most easily segmented in the coronal plane of a diffusion-weighted image (DWI). This structure may be completely indistinguishable from surrounding regions on T2-weighted MRI. The rostral aspect of the amygdala begins as a light (low diffusivity) region just ventral to the dark (high diffusivity), ellipsoid, diagonal domain at roughly the level of the optic chiasm. Moving caudally, the lateral border of the amygdala is distinguishable from the adjacent cortex based on the dark appearance of layer 2 of the piriform cortex. The medial extent is easily identified based on the dark border created by the lateral hypothalamus and diagonal domain. The dorsal border of the amygdala with the striatum is defined by the start of the striations that define the caudate\/putamen. The border with the hippocampus is equally straightforward due to the dark appearance of the alveus. The caudal border of the amygdala is a circular bulge of dark tissue on the ventral-most part of the allocortex (the posteromedial cortical amygdaloid nucleus), which emerges at around the level of the genu of the corpus callosum."}}
