Glucagon is synthesized in a special non- pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli bacteria that has been genetically altered by the addition of the gene for glucagons Pharmacology: Used in the treatment of hypoglycemia and in gastric imaging, glucagon increases blood glucose concentration and is used in the treatment of hypoglycemia. Glucagon acts only on liver glycogen, converting it to glucose through the release of insulin. It also relaxes the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract. Mechanism of action: Glucagon binds the glucagon receptor which then initiates a dual signaling pathway using both adenylate cyclase activation and increased intracellular calcium. Glucagon receptors are found in the liver, kidney, brain and pancreatic islet cells. The glucagon mediated signals lead to an increase in insulin excretion Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Antihypoglycemic Agents"}}
