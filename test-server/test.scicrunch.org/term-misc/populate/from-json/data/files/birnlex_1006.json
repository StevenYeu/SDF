{"Middle temporal sulcus":{"NeuronamesLink":"http:\/\/braininfo.rprc.washington.edu\/Scripts\/hiercentraldirectory.aspx?ID","Created":"2006-10-05","EditorialNote":"UMLS has several CUIs that map to this class: C0228241, C0228242, and C1110644.  The last appears to be macaque-only and therefore the one that most directly maps to NN use.  C0228241 appears to be a narrowly defined term (species-independent), whereas C0228242 consists of a large collection of different terms.","NeuronamesID":"113","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Sulcus","Curator":"Bill Bug","Id":"birnlex_1006","Is part of":"Temporal lobe"}}
