It is found abundantly in nature in laterite ore minerals, such as limonite, garnierite, and pentlandite. Pure nickel is mainly used to make alloys, which are found in items such as coins, jewelry, valves and heat exchangers. Nickel compounds are used for nickel plating, to color ceramics, to make some batteries, and as catalysts. Nickel also has a biological role, and is found in certain enzymes, including urease, hydrogenase, methylcoenzyme M reductase, and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase."}}
