In the transmission electron microscope, these cells are characterized by a darkly stained nucleus surrounded by a thin rim of cytoplasm.  The axon ascends into the molecular layer where it bifurcates to form parallel fibers which run parallel to the long axis of the folium.  Llinas, Walton and Lang. Cerebellum.
