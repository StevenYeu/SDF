It is pharmacologically similar to aspirin, but causes less gastrointestinal bleeding. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Fenoprofen is a propionic acid derivative with analgesic, antiinflammatory and antipyretic properties. Fenoprofen inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by decreasing the enzyme needed for biosynthesis. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the anti-inflammatory action of fenoprofen has been evidenced by relief of pain, increase in grip strength, and reductions in joint swelling, duration of morning stiffness, and disease activity (as assessed by both the investigator and the patient). In patients with osteoarthritis, the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of fenoprofen have been demonstrated by reduction in tenderness as a response to pressure and reductions in night pain, stiffness, swelling, and overall disease activity (as assessed by both the patient and the investigator). These effects have also been demonstrated by relief of pain with motion and at rest and increased range of motion in involved joints. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, clinical studies have shown fenoprofen to be comparable to aspirin in controlling the aforementioned measures of disease activity, but mild gastrointestinal reactions (nausea, dyspepsia) and tinnitus occurred less frequently in patients treated with fenoprofen than in aspirin-treated patients. It is not known whether fenoprofen causes less peptic ulceration than does aspirin. In patients with pain, the analgesic action of fenoprofen has produced a reduction in pain intensity, an increase in pain relief, improvement in total analgesia scores, and a sustained analgesic effect. Mechanism of action: Fenoprofen's exact mode of action is unknown, but it is thought that prostaglandin synthetase inhibition is involved. Fenoprofen has been shown to inhibit prostaglandin synthetase isolated from bovine seminal vesicles. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal.
