Seizures are characterized by PARESTHESIA and tonic or clonic activity of the lower face associated with drooling and dysarthria. The episodes tend to occur at night and may become secondarily generalized. In most cases, affected children are neurologically and developmentally normal. The electroencephalogram shows characteristic high-voltage sharp waves over the central temporal regions, which are more prominent during drowsiness and sleep. In general, seizures do not continue beyond mid-adolescence (MeSH)."}}
