It is biosynthesized enzymatically from prostaglandin endoperoxides in human vascular tissue. The sodium salt has been also used to treat primary pulmonary hypertension. Pharmacology: Epoprostenol has two major pharmacological actions: (1) direct vasodilation of pulmonary and systemic arterial vascular beds, and (2) inhibition of platelet aggregation. In animals, the vasodilatory effects reduce right and left ventricular afterload and increase cardiac output and stroke volume. The effect of epoprostenol on heart rate in animals varies with dose. At low doses, there is vagally mediated brudycardia, but at higher doses, epoprostenol causes reflex tachycardia in response to direct vasodilation and hypotension. No major effects on cardiac conduction have been observed. Additional pharmacologic effects of epoprostenol in animals include bronchodilation, inhibition of gastric acid secretion, and decreased gastric emptying. No available chemical assay is sufficiently sensitive and specific to assess the in vivo human pharmacokinetics of epoprostenol. Mechanism of action: Prostaglandins are present in most body tissues and fluids and mediate many biological functions. Epoprostenol is a member of the family of prostaglandins that is derived from arachidonic acid. The major pharmacological actions of epoprostenol are mediated via inhibition of platelet aggregation. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antihypertensive Agents. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}}
