It is closely related to diphenhydramine HCl, or Benadryl. It is primarily a H1-antagonist, but also possesses an antimuscarinic effect. Pharmacology: Dimenhydrinate is an antiemetics drug combination that contains diphenhydramine and theophylline. It is not effective in the treatment of nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy. Dimenhydrinate directly inhibits the stimulation of certain nerves in the brain and inner ear to suppress nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and vertigo. Mechanism of action: The mechanism by which some antihistamines exert their antiemetic, antimotion sickness, and antivertigo effects is not precisely known but may be related to their central anticholinergic actions. They diminish vestibular stimulation and depress labyrinthine function. An action on the medullary chemoreceptive trigger zone may also be involved in the antiemetic effect. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antiemetics. Histamine H1 Antagonists"}}
