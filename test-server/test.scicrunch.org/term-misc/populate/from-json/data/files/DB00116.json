It is produced from dihydrofolic acid by dihydrofolate reductase.It is converted into 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate by serine hydroxymethyltransferase. It is a coenzyme in many reactions, especially in the metabolism of amino acids and nucleic acids. It acts as a donor of a group with one carbon atom. It gets this carbon atom by sequestering formaldehyde produced in other processes. Pharmacology: Tetrahydrofolate is the main active metabolite of dietary folate. It is vital as a coenzyme in reactions involving transfers of single carbon groups. Tetrahydrofolate has a role in nucleic and amino acid synthesis. As nucleic and amino acid synthesis is affected by a deficiency of tetrahydrofolate, actively dividing and growing cells tend to be the first affected. Tetrahydrofolate is used to treat topical sprue and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias, hematologic complications resulting from a deficiency in folic acid. Mechanism of action: Tetrahydrofolate is transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where it is needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate. Drug type: Approved. Nutraceutical. Small Molecule. Drug category: Dietary supplement. Micronutrient"}}
