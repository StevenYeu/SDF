    The Usage and Citation Metrics section provides researchers a simple way to explore citations of the use of this resource. Researchers can use this information to help them make a more information decision about using the resources in a study. The "View All" feature in this section provides a year distribution chart of articles, full list of articles, and additional filters.

<p>
    Currently, the citation information is updated automatically as the RRID-based text mining pipeline (see <b>Table 1</b>) finds new papers that cite this resource from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/">PubMed Central (PMC) Open Access Subset (OA Subset)</a>. As of February, 2021, there were <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=open+access%5Bfilter%5D">over 3 million articles</a> available in PMC Open Access Subset. The dkNET team is continuously working on expanding citation data from more publishers (see <b>Table 2</b> for updated coverage), and the total number of articles has been reached to 4 million in February 2020. Due to restriction on the use of the articles, the usage data here only represents a partial subset of all publications. For more complete resource mentions (i.e., mentions in non-open access journal papers, theses and dissertations, academic books, pre-prints, abstracts, technical reports, patent...etc.), please check Google Scholar.
</p>
<p>
    While we are expanding our citation data, for your convenience, we have also created a link to help you to directly find articles that have mentioned RRIDs via Google Scholar.
</p>
<p>
    We normally update data in Usage and Citation Metrics section monthly. However, it may take 6 months or longer for PMC to have most recently published articles.
