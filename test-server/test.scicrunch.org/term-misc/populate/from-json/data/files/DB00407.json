It is used for prevention of deep vein thrombosis. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Ardeparin, an anticoagulant, is a fractionated heparin. It acts at multiple sites in the normal coagulation system to inhibit reactions that lead to the clotting of blood and the formation of fibrin clots both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanism of action: Ardeparin binds to antithrombin III, accelerating its activity and inactivating factor Xa and thrombin, thereby inhibiting thrombosis. Ardeparin also binds to heparin cofactor II, inhibiting thrombin. Ardeparin does not effect prothrombin time (PT) assays and may prolong activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). Ardeparin has double the anti-factor Xa activity of anti-factor IIa activity, compared to unfractionated heparin which has approximately equal anti-factor Xa activity and anti-factor IIa activity. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anticoagulants. Fibrinolytic Agents"}}
