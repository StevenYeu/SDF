The antibody is an IgG1 kappa immunoglobulin containing murine light- and heavy-chain variable region sequences and human constant region sequences. Rituximab is composed of two heavy chains of 451 amino acids and two light chains of 213 amino acids Pharmacology: Rituxan binds to the CD20 antigen, which is predominantly expressed on mature B cells and on >90% of B-cellnon-Hodgkin's lympohomas. The antibody leads to selective killing of B-cells. Mechanism of action: Binds to the CD20 antigen which is found on mature B lymphocytes. The Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis. The antibody appears to induce apoptosis, antibody mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Antineoplastic Agents"}}
