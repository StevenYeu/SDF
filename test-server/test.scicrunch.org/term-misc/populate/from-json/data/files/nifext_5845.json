It is a protien that is encoded, in humans, by the DRD1 gene. The D1 subtype is the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system. This G-protein coupled receptor stimulates adenylyl cyclase and activates cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases. D1 receptors are enriched in Caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, and olfactory tubercles. These receptors regulate neuronal growth and development, mediate some behavioral responses, and modulate dopamine receptor D2-mediated events. Alternate transcription initiation sites result in two transcript variants of this gene. (adapted from Entrez Gene)"}}
