Glycoprotein that is 127 residues. Substitution of Leu23 leads to a difference from native protein. Pharmacology: Sargramostim is used in the treatment of bone marrow transplant recipients or those exposed to chemotherapy an recovering from acut myelogenous leukemia, Leukine or GM-CSF is a hematopoietic growth factor which stimulates the survival, clonal expansion (proliferation) and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. GM-CSF is also capable of activating mature granulocytes and macrophages. After a bone marrow transplant or chemotherapy, patients have a reduced capacity to produce red and white blood cells. Supplementing them with external sources of GM-CSF helps bring the level of neutrophils back to normal so that they can better fight infections. Mechanism of action: Sargramostim binds to the Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor (GM-CSF-R-alpha or CSF2R) which stimulates a JAK2 STAT1\/STAT3 signal transduction pathway. This leads to the production of hemopoietic cells and neutrophils Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Anti-Infective Agents. Antineoplastic Agents. Immunomodulatory Agents"}}
