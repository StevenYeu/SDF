The CA1 Interneuron Specific (IS) type II cell is VIP+. The soma was reported mainly in stratum radiatum and the border with lacunosum-moleculare, and the dendrites are mostly in stratum lacunosum-moleculare (Acsady et al. 1996b; Gulyas et al. 1996). The axon innervates mainly CCK\/VIP positive basket cells (Acsady et al. 1996b; Gulyas et al. 1996). The possible expression of calretinin by these cells is not known."}}
