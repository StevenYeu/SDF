{"Feed-forward inhibition":{"RelatedTo":"Local Circuit role","Synonym":"Reciprocal inhibition","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Electrophysiology concept","Id":"oen_0001154","Definition":"An inhibitory circuit in which a neuron both directly excites a target and indirectly inhibits it by exciting an interposed inhibtory neuron.  This type of circuit, common in the reciprocal innervation activated by monosynaptic reflex systems, coordinates competing the inhibition of an extensor muscle."}}
