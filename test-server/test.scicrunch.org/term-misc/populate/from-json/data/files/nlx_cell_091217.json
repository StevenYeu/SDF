Comp. Neurol. PMID: 19496174","Definition":"The CA3 Radiatum (R) neurons are interneurons with somata in stratum radiatum which receives converging stimulation from the DG and entorhinal cortex as well as from within CA3. The dendritic tree of R interneurons typically extend between the dorsal blade of the dentate gyrus and the stratum pyramidale of CA3. The axonal branches often extend beyond their layer of somatic residence into stratum lacunosum-moleculare or stratum pyramidale."}}
