{"Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["BNST p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","PartiallyOverlapsWith":"Bed nucleus of stria terminalis","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151534","Is part of":"Subpallium of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Species":"Rat","Definition":"The BST is most easily segmented on coronal diffusion weighted images (DWI). Rostrally, the BST begins as a bright (low diffusivity) triangular region surrounding the anterior limbs of the anterior commissure. More caudally this triangular region expands and is easily distinguished from the dark (high diffusivity) internal capsule laterally and fornix medially. The ventral border with the slightly darker preoptic area and hypothalamus is subtle. At its caudal border the BST retracts in to a small bright area just ventral to the ventral hippocampal commissure."}}
