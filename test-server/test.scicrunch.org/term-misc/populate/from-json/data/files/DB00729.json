It binds muscarinic acetycholine receptors and thereby decreases secretory excretion of stomach acids as well as saliva and sweat. Pharmacology: Diphemanil Methylsulfate is a quaternary ammonium anticholinergic. It binds muscarinic acetycholine receptors and thereby decreases secretory excretion of stomach acids as well as saliva and sweat. Mechanism of action: Diphemanil Methylsulfate exerts its action by primarily binding the muscarinic M3 receptor. M3 receptors are located in the smooth muscles of the blood vessels, as well as in the lungs. This means they cause vasodilation and bronchoconstriction. They are also in the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), which help in increasing intestinal motility and dilating sphincters. The M3 receptors are also located in many glands which help to stimulate secretion in salivary glands and other glands of the body. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Bronchodilator Agents. Muscarinic Antagonists. Parasympatholytics"}}
