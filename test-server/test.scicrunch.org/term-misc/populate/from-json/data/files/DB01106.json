Levocabastine was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1979. Pharmacology: Levocabastine is a selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist exerting inhibitory effects on the release of chemical mediators from mast cells and on the chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and eosinophils. Both histamine and antigens induced conjunctivitis can be inhibited by levocabastine. Levocabastine can also reduce symptoms of allergic rhinitis by preventing an increase in vascular permeability of nasal mucosa. Mechanism of action: Levocabastine is a potent, selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist. It works by competing with histamine for H1-receptor sites on effector cells. It thereby prevents, but does not reverse, responses mediated by histamine alone. Levocabastine does not block histamine release but, rather, prevents histamine binding and activity. Levocabastine also binds neurotensin 2 receptors and serves as a neurotensin agonist. This can induce some degree of analgesia. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Histamine H1 Antagonists. Histamine H1 Antagonists, Non-Sedating"}}
