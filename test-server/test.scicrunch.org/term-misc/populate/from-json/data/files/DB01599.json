(From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p993). Pharmacology: Probucol is a powerful antioxidant drug normally used to prevent vascular disease caused by the free radicals in the body. Mechanism of action: Probucol lowers serum cholesterol by increasing the fractional rate of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) catabolism in the final metabolic pathway for cholesterol elimination from the body. Additionally, probucol may inhibit early stages of cholesterol biosynthesis and slightly inhibit dietary cholesterol absorption. Recent information suggests that probucol may inhibit the oxidation and tissue deposition of LDL cholesterol, thereby inhibiting atherogenesis. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anticholesteremic Agents. Antioxidants"}}
