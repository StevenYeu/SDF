{"Western blot protocol":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Protocol","Id":"nlx_inv_091033","Xref":"PAR:0113","Definition":"A protocol that uses a Western blot assay to identify and quantify a binder protein interaction. A mixture of protein is first submitted to an electrophoresis in denaturing condition and then electro-transferred from the gel to a membrane. The membrane is then incubated with a primary antibody specific for a given protein or a specific residue modification in the sample under analysis. A secondary antibody, radiolabelled or fused to fluorophore or to a chromogenic enzyme, targets the first antibody and allows the visualisation of the protein band on the membrane.
