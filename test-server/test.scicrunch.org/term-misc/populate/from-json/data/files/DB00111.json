Daclizumab is a composite of human (90%) and murine (10%) antibody sequences. The human sequences were derived from the constant domains of human IgG1 and the variable framework regions of the Eu myeloma antibody. The murine sequences were derived from the complementarity-determining regions of a murine anti-Tac antibody. Pharmacology: Zenapax functions as an IL-2 receptor antagonist. Specifically it inhibits IL-2-mediated activation of lymphocytes, a critical pathway in the cellular immune response involved in allograft rejection. Mechanism of action: Zenepax binds with high-affinity to the Tac subunit of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor complex and inhibits IL-2 binding. The IL-2 receptor (Tac) subunit is expressed on activated but not resting lymphocytes. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Immunomodulatory Agents. Immunosuppressive Agents"}}
