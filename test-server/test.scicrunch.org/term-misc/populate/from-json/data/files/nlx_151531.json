{"Olfactory Structures of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["olfactory p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151531","Is part of":"Pallium of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"The olfactory structures (olfactory bulbs, olfactory tubercles, and piriform cortex) can be segmented in coronal T2-weighted or diffusion-weighted images. Rostrally, the olfactory bulbs are free-floating and therefore easily segmented. Further caudal, as the isocortex appears dorsally, the border between the two is defined by the thin rostral extent of the lateral olfactory tract, which is dark on T2 MRI. A horizontal line connecting the two rhinal fissures that is slightly convex towards the dorsal surface of brain approximates the dividing line between these two regions of cortex as far caudal as the mamillary bodies. Caudal to the mamillary bodies the dividing line between isocortex and piriform cortex can be defined based on the dorsal extent of layer 2 of the piriform cortex, which appears quite dark (high diffusivity) of diffusion-weighted images. At roughly the caudal extent of the amygdala (the posteromedial cortical amygdaloid nucleus) the piriform cortex disappears abruptly giving way to the entorhinal cortex, which we have included in the isocortex."}}
