The \u03b16 subunit found in certain types of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors found primarily in the brain. Neural nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing \u03b16 subunits are expressed on dopamine-releasing neurons in the midbrain, and dopamine release following activation of these neurons is thought to be involved in the addictive properties of nicotine. Due to their selective localisation on dopaminergic neurons, \u03b16-containing nACh receptors have also been suggested as a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.(Adapted from PRotein Ontology and Wikipedia)."}}
