In 1983, Armstrong et al. recognized that these neurons in rats are cholinergic, and closely related to a second cluster of cholinergic cells in the adjacent laterodorsal tegmental nucleus.  In 1987, Rye et al. defined this cell group in rats, gave references to the earlier literature, and demonstrated that it is NOT the target of the descending pallidal projection, but rather next to a region, the Midbrain Extrapyramidal Area (MEA) that does receive this input.  Some modern definitions include many non-cholinergic cells that are interspersed among the cholinergic neurons within the \"PPT,\" but those other cell groups often extend beyond the borders of the cholinergic one, have never been characterized, and many are probably unrelated to it (or have quite different functions).  Hence, for this definition, we are restricting the use to the cholinergic cell group, which was originally given this name by Jacobsohn."}}
