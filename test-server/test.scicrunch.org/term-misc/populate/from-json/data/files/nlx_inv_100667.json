{"Physiology":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Scientific_discipline","Id":"nlx_inv_100667","Definition":"From BRO: Branch of biology dealing with the study of the mechanical, physical, and biochemical functions of living organisms.Physiology has traditionally been divided between plant physiology and animal and all living things physiology but the principles of physiology are universal, no matter what particular organism is being studied. For example, what is learned about the physiology of yeast cells may also apply to human cells.The field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of human physiology to non-human animal species. Plant physiology also borrows techniques from both fields. Its scope of subjects is at least as diverse as the tree of life itself. Due to this diversity of subjects, research in animal physiology tends to concentrate on understanding how physiological traits changed throughout the evolutionary history of animals. Other major branches of scientific study that have grown out of physiology research include biochemistry, biophysics, paleobiology, biomechanics, and pharmacology. - definition adapted from Wikipedia"}}
