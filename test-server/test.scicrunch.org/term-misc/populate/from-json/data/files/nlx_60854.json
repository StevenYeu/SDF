Peruzzi et al. (1997) showed that the cell type is also found in rats, and  sends action potentials more rapidly than glutamatergic IC neurons. Ito and colleagues (2009) showed that the cell type is the largest neuron in the IC and receives dense VGLUT2-positive axosomatic terminals on the cell body. Other cell types such as glutamatergic neurons and small GABAergic neurons do not have such endings."}}
