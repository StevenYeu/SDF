Tinea infections are superficial fungal infections caused by three species of fungi collectively known as dermatophytes (Trichophyton, Microsporum and Epidermophyton). Commonly these infections are named for the body part affected, including tinea corporis (general skin), tinea cruris (groin), and tinea pedis (feet). Haloprogin is a halogenated phenolic ether administered topically for dermotaphytic infections. The mechanism of action is unknown, but also presumed to interfere with yeast membrane structure and function. Pharmacology: Used as a topical ointment or cream in the treatment of Tinea infections. Tinea infections are superficial fungal infections caused by three species of fungi collectively known as dermatophytes (Trichophyton, Microsporum and Epidermophyton). Commonly these infections are named for the body part affected, including tinea corporis (general skin), tinea cruris (groin), and tinea pedis (feet). Mechanism of action: Haloprogin is a halogenated phenolic ether administered topically for dermotaphytic infections. The mechanism of action is unknown, but also presumed to interfere with yeast membrane structure and function. There is a higher incidence of cutaneous side effects with haloprogin, including irritation, burning, vesiculation (blisters), scaling, and itching. It is generally used when the infection is unresponsive to other antifungals. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-fungal Agents"}}
