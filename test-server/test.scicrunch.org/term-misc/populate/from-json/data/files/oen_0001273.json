{"Evoked potential":{"Synonym":"Event Related Potentials","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Membrane potential","Id":"oen_0001273","Has role":"Electrophysiology concept","Xref":"D005071","Definition":"The recorded electrical responses from nerve, muscle, SENSORY RECEPTOR, or area of the CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM following stimulation. They range from less than a microvolt to several microvolts. The evoked potential can be auditory (EVOKED POTENTIALS, AUDITORY), somatosensory (EVOKED POTENTIALS, SOMATOSENSORY), visual (EVOKED POTENTIALS, VISUAL), or motor (EVOKED POTENTIALS, MOTOR), or other modalities that have been reported. Often used synonymously to event-related potentials which are associated with higher level cognitive processes."}}
