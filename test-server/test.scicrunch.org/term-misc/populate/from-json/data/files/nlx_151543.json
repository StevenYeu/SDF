{"Ventricles of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["ventricles p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151543","Is part of":"Developmentally Diverse Structures of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"If available, diffusion-weighted images allow surprisingly simple and rapid segmentation of the entire ventricular system. The ventricles, being comprised mostly of fluid space with loosely packed chorioid plexus, have very high diffusivity relative to the rest of the brain and appears very dark on DWI. A simple seeded threshold (magic wand) tool in the dorsal third ventricle just ventral to the ventral hippocampal commissure is often sufficient to segment the entire ventricular system. Depending on image resolution, and particularly the ability to resolve the aqueduct and rostral lateral ventricles, other seeds may need to be placed in these locations."}}
