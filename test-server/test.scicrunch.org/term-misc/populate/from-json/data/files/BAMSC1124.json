The superficial field is a circumsomatic field and the deep field is elongated to reach into the deeper portion of the zone of vertical cells. The cell body is about the size of an intermediate vertical fusiform cell soma. The axon is similar, but more apt to have collaterals to the superficial zones. Inverted pyramidal cells fall within the definition of the narrow field vertical cells."}}
