The term has come to be identified with the clusters of granule cells found in the olfactory tubercle but the original paper may have been pointing to the dense cell layer. He recommended that it be dropped (Millhouse, J Comp Neurol., 265: 1-24, 1987).Meyer et al. prefer that only those aggregates within the olfactory tubercle be called Islands of Calleja and that the term \"clusters of granule cells\" be adopted elsewhere.","PublicationDate":"1989","SuperCategory":"Regional part of brain","PublicationName":"Journal of Comparative Neurology","Id":"nlx_50741","JournalNumber":"3","Is part of":["Olfactory tubercle"],"ParcellationScheme":"Meyer et al 1989","Species":"Mammal","Definition":"Part of olfactory tubercle defined by dense aggregations of granule cells"}}
