Norepinephrine is the principal transmitter of most postganglionic sympathetic fibers and of the diffuse projection system in the brain arising from the locus ceruleus. It is also found in plants and is used pharmacologically as a sympathomimetic. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Noradrenaline acts on both alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors to cause vasoconstriction. Its effect in-vitro is often limited to the increasing of blood pressure through antagonising alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors and causing a resultant increase in systemic vascular resistance. Mechanism of action: Norepinephrine functions as a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and as an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries (beta-adrenergic action). Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Adrenergic alpha-Agonists. Sympathomimetics. Vasoconstrictor Agents"}}
