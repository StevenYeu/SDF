{"Bicarbonate stimulus transduction":{"Synonym":"pH stimulus transduction","Created":"2008-03-13","CurationStatus":"graph_position_temporary","SuperCategory":"Molecule flow stimulus transduction","Id":"birnlex_15008","Definition":"A sensory transduction event whereby chemoreceptors in the carotid body of higher mammals detect the amount of plasma bicarbonate communicating this signal to medullary neurons involved in control of respiratory rate.  Higher pH derives primarily from higher plasma pCO2.  The medullary neurons increase respiratory rate in response to a rise in pH, so as to vent more CO2 and thereby decrease pH back toward neutral (BB: 2008-03-13)"}}
