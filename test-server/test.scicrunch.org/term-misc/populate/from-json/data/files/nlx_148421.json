Cells preferentially activated by low-frequency vibration are loosely distributed as a ring in the middle layer of JON cell bodies. Higher frequencies preferentially activate JON neurons with cell bodies likely located mainly in the inner layer, directly surrounding the antennal nerve (Kamikouchi et al., 2006). These neurons are also transiently activated by the onset and offset of arista displacement."}}
