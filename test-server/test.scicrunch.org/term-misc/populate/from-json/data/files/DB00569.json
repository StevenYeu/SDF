It contains a synthetic pentasaccharide. Apart from the O-methyl group at the reducing end of the molecule, the identity and sequence of the five monomeric sugar units contained in Fondaparinux is identical to a sequence of five monomeric sugar units that can be isolated after either chemical or enzymatic cleavage of the polymeric glycosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate (HS). Within heparin and heparan sulfate this monomeric sequence is thought to form the high affinity binding site for the anti-coagulant factor antithrombin III (ATIII). Binding of heparin\/HS to ATIII has been shown to increase the anti-coagulant activity of antithrombin III 1000 fold. Clinically, fondaparinux is used for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis in patients who have had orthopedic surgery as well as for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Pharmacology: Fondaparinux is a synthetic and specific inhibitor of activated Factor X (Xa) indicated for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis, which may lead to pulmonary embolism. Fondaparinux is also indicated for the treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis when administered in conjunction with warfarin, and the treatment of acute pulmonary embolism when administered in conjunction with warfarin. Fondaparinux does not inactivate thrombin (activated Factor II) and has no known effect on platelet function. At the recommended dose, Fondaparinux does not affect fibrinolytic activity or bleeding time. Mechanism of action: The antithrombotic activity of Fondaparinux is the result of antithrombin III (ATIII)-mediated selective inhibition of Factor Xa. By selectively binding to ATIII, Fondaparinux potentiates (about 300 times) the innate neutralization of Factor Xa by ATIII. Neutralization of Factor Xa interrupts the blood coagulation cascade and thus inhibits thrombin formation and thrombus development. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anticoagulants. Antithrombotics"}}
