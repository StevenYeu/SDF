It is an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Mefenamic acid, an anthranilic acid derivative, is a member of the fenamate group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities. Similar to other NSAIDs, mefenamic acid inhibits prostaglandin synthetase. Mechanism of action: Mefenamic acid binds the prostaglandin synthetase receptors COX-1 and COX-2, inhibiting the action of prostaglandin synthetase. As these receptors have a role as a major mediator of inflammation and\/or a role for prostanoid signaling in activity-dependent plasticity, the symptoms of pain are temporarily reduced. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal. Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}}
