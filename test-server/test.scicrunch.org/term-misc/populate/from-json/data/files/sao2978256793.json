{"MAP5":{"SuperCategory":"Protein","Id":"sao2978256793","Definition":"A microtubule-associated protein that appears to be evenly distributed throughout axons, dendrites, and neuronal cell bodies. It is absent in synapses, which make it distinguishable from other MAPs (1, 2, 3, and tau). It is not present in dendritic spines, axon terminals, or other synaptic elements. It is present at significantly higher levels in neonatal brain than adult."}}
