It is produced in an antibiotic-free culture of mammalian cells. It can be covalently linked to Iodine 131 (a radioactive isotope of iodine). Pharmacology: Tositumomab binds to the CD20 antigen, which is predominantly expressed on mature B cells and on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lympohomas. The antibody leads to selective killing of B-cells. Mechanism of action: Binds to the CD20 antigen which is found on mature B lymphocytes. The antibody binding appears to induce apoptosis, complement-dependent cytotoxicity and cell death through ionizing radiation. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Antineoplastic Agents"}}
