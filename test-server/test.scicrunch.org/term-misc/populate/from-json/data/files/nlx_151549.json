{"Internal Capsule of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["ic p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151549","Is part of":"Major White Matter Structures of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"The internal capsule and the white matter tracts that flow from it (cerebral peduncles, longitudinal fasciculus, pyramids) are easily segmented on coronal T2-weighted images. These dense white matter tracts appear much darker that a majority of surrounding highly cellular nuclei. The rostral extent of the internal capsule is a dark, vertically oriented, speckled band that appears between the lighter bed nucleus of the stria terminalis medially and the more striated pallidum laterally. Moving caudally, this band becomes thicker, darker and concave medially as it courses lateral to the might lighter appearing diencephalon. Just rostral to the pituitary the internal capsule\/cerebral peduncle is bisected by the fimbria and stria terminalis. The medial portion is a thick, dark band at roughly a 45-degree angle that dips slightly in to the hypothalamus. The lateral portion is a very dark triangular region surrounded by the lighter corpus callosum\/external capsule laterally, the lighter stria terminalis medially and the speckled caudate\/putamen ventrally. Further caudal, the cerebral peduncle becomes a very dark crescent just ventral and medial to the pale-appearing substantia nigra. These crescents coalesce in to a dark circular bundle as they traverse the lighter pontine nuclei and course towards the ventral surface of the brainstem to become the pyramids. The pyramids appear as two very dark circular bundles on the ventral surface of the brainstem and are easy to distinguish from the surrounding trapezoid bodies and medial lemnisci. The pyramids end where they turn dorsally and cross to form the dorsal corticospinal tract of the spinal cord."}}
