{"Conditioned place preference paradigm":{"Synonym":["environmental place conditioning","conditioned place preference"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Behavioral conditioning paradigm","Id":"nlx_444","Definition":"A behavioral conditioning paradigm where the animal is presented with a positive stimulus (e.g., food or the effects of a drug of abuse) paired with placement in a distinct environment containing various cues (e.g., tactile, visual, and\/or olfactory). When later tested in the normal state, measures of the preference for the compartments previously associated with the positive stimulus, e.g., approaches or amount of time spent in the compartment,  serves as an indicator of preference and a measure of reward learning. This paradigm is commonly used in animal studies to evaluate preferences for environmental stimuli that have been associated with a positive or negative reward. The technique is often used to determine the addiction potential of drugs. (adapted from Wikipedia)"}}
