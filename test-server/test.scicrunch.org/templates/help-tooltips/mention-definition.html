<p>What is a mention?</p>
<p>A mention is a short statement citing this resource in a paper. Currently, the citation information is updated automatically as the RRID-based text mining pipeline finds new papers that cite this resource from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/">PubMed Central (PMC) Open Access Subset (OA Subset)</a>. We also include additional citations uploaded directly from users such as resource owners. For tools, we include additional results from searching for resource name and URL.</p>
