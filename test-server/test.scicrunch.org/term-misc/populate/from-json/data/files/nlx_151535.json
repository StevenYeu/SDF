{"Diagonal Domain of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["diagonal domain p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151535","Is part of":"Subpallium of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"The diagonal domain can be segmented on diffusion-weighted images (DWI) in the coronal plane. The rostral extent of the diagonal domain is defined by a dark (high diffusivity) patch at the midline just medial to the light (low diffusivity) accumbens nucleus. The vertical limbs, which also appear dark relative to surrounding tissue, extend ventrolaterally just beneath the row of dark patches that defines the ventral pallidum. Caudally, the dark, horizontal limbs fade away as they extend in to the lateral hypothalamus."}}
