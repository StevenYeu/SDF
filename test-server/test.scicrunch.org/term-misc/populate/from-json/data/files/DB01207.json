However, there currently are no clinical indications for preferential use of ridogrel over aspirin. Pharmacology: Ridogrel, a combined thromboxane synthase inhibitor and receptor antagonist, is used with streptokinase as an adjunctive therapy to reduce the formation and size of blood clots. Blood clots can cause ischemic cardiac events (heart attacks). Ridogrel has the dual property of inhibiting the synthesis of thromboxane and blocking the receptors of thromboxane\/prostaglandin\/endoperoxides. It has been shown to accelerate the speed of recanalization and to delay or prevent reocclusion during systemic thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (streptokinase). Ridogrel is a more potent antiplatelet agent than aspirin and might offer an advantage over aspirin as an adjunct to thrombolysis in patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction. While aspirin inhibits cyclooxygenase, the enzyme responsible for producing thromboxane, ridogrel inhibits thromboxane synthesis directly. A recent comparison between aspirin and ridogrel in as adjunct to thrombolysis in patients with acute myocardial infarction demonstrated that ridogrel is not superior to aspirin in enhancing the fibrinolytic efficacy of streptokinase but might be more effective in preventing new ischemic events. Clinical experience with this drug is still relatively limited. Mechanism of action: Ridogrel inhibits thromboxane A2 synthase and also blocks the thromboxane A2\/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptors.Thromboxane synthetase produces thromboxane in platelets. Thromboxane is a vasoconstrictor and facilitates the clumping of platelets. Therefore by inhibiting the production and promotion of thromboxane, thrombolysis is reduced. Drug type: Approved.
