{"PET imaging protocol":{"Created":"2007-03-07","Synonym":["Positron Emission Tomography imaging protocol"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","Umlscui":"C0032743","SuperCategory":"Nuclear medicine imaging protocol","Id":"birnlex_2171","Abbrev":"PET","Definition":"* A technique for measuring the gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons (anti-electrons) within living tissue. In positron emission tomography (PET), a subject is given a dose of a positron-emitting radionuclide attached to a metabolically active substance (for example, 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), which is similar to a naturally occurring sugar, glucose, with the addition of a radioactive fluorine atom). When living tissue containing the positron emitter is bombarded by electrons, gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons is detected by a scanner, revealing in fine detail the tissue location of the metabolically-active substance administered. (NCI04) (NCI) * An imaging technique using compounds labelled with short-lived positron-emitting radionuclides (such as carbon-11, nitrogen-13, oxygen-15 and fluorine-18) to measure cell metabolism. It has been useful in study of soft tissues such as CANCER; CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM; and BRAIN. SPECT is closely related to PET, but uses isotopes with longer half-lives and resolution is lower. (MSH) * For this type of scan, a person is given a substance that reacts with tissues in the body to release protons (parts of an atom). Through measuring the different amounts of protons released by healthy and cancerous tissues, a computer creates a picture of the inside of the body. PET images show the chemical functioning of an organ or tissue, unlike X-ray, CT, or MRI which show only body structure. Also called PET scan. (NCI) * detection of gamma rays emitted from tissues after administration of a natural substance such as glucose or fatty acids into which positron emitting isotopes have been incorporated; the paths of the gamma rays, which result from collisions of positrons and electrons, are interpreted by a computer algorithm, and the resultant tomogram represents local concentrations of the isotope containing substance.
