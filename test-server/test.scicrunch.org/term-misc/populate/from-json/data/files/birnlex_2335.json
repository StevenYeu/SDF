{"Controlled vocabulary":{"Synonym":["controlled terminology"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Data or information resource","Id":"birnlex_2335","Keywords":"Resource:CINERGI","Definition":"In library and information science controlled vocabulary is a carefully selected list of words and phrases, which are used to tag units of information (document or work) so that they may be more easily retrieved by a search. Controlled vocabularies solve the problems of homographs, synonyms and polysemes by ensuring that each concept is described using only one authorized term and each authorized term in the controlled vocabulary describes only one concept. In short, controlled vocabularies reduce ambiguity inherent in normal human languages where the same concept can be given different names and ensure consistency.  Controlled vocabulary schemes mandate the uses of predefined, authorized terms that have been preselected by the designer of the controlled vocabulary as opposed to natural language vocabularies where there is no restriction on the vocabulary that can be used.
