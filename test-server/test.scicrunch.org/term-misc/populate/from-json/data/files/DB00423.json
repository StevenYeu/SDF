It is used as an adjunct in the symptomatic treatment of musculoskeletal conditions associated with painful muscle spasm. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1206) Pharmacology: Methocarbamol is a central muscle relaxant for skeletal muscles, used to treat spasms. It is structurally related to guaifenesin. Methocarbamol's exact mechanism of causing skeletal muscle relaxation is unknown. It is thought to work centrally, perhaps by general depressant effects. It has no direct relaxant effects on striated muscle, nerve fibers, or the motor endplate. It will not directly relax contracted skeletal muscles. The drug has a secondary sedative effect. Mechanism of action: The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to central nervous system depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Muscle Relaxants, Central"}}
