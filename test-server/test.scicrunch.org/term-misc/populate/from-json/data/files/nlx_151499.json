{"Giant axonal neuropathy":{"RelatedTo":["GAN1","gigaxonin"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Neuropathy","Id":"nlx_151499","Abbrev":"GAN","DefinitionPMID":"22806374","Definition":"A progressive hereditary disease that affects the peripheral and central nervous systems. It is characterized morphologically by aggregates of intermediate filaments in different tissues. Mutations have been reported in the gene that codes for gigaxonin.  Morphologically, GAN is characterized by the presence of giant axons filled with densely packed accumulations of neurofilaments (NF). Affected axons have a thin myelin sheath, do not transmit signals properly, and eventually perish. Unique to GAN is that in addition to the inclusions in neurons, astrocytes can be filled with glial filament bodies, fibroblasts with vimentin clusters and muscle fibers with desmin accumulations. "}}
