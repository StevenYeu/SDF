Eszopiclone is the active stereoisomer of zopiclone, and belongs to the class of drugs known as cyclopyrrones.Its main selling point is that it is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for long-term use, unlike almost all other hypnotic sedatives, which are approved only for the relief of short-term (6-8 weeks) insomnia. Pharmacology: Eszopiclone is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic, pyrrolopyrazine derivative of the cyclopyrrolone class and is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. While Eszopiclone is a hypnotic agent with a chemical structure unrelated to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other drugs with known hypnotic properties, it interacts with the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine (GABABZ) receptor complex. Subunit modulation of the GABABZ receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex is hypothesized to be responsible for some of the pharmacological properties of benzodiazepines, which include sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsive effects in animal models. Eszopiclone binds selectively to the brain alpha subunit of the GABA A omega-1 receptor. Mechanism of action: The mechanism of action of Eszopiclone is not completely understood. It isthought that Eszopiclone acts on the benzodiazepine receptors and interacts with GABA-receptor complexes. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Hypnotics and Sedatives"}}
