{"Streptokinase":{"RelatedTo":["Plasminogen","Urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor","Proteinase-activated receptor 1"],"Synonym":["Streptokinase C precursor"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB00086","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB00086","Definition":"Streptokinase, is a sterile, purified preparation of a bacterial protein elaborated by group C (beta) -hemolytic streptococci. Pharmacology: Streptokinase cleaves the Arg\/Val bond in plasminogen to form the proteolytic enzyme plasmin. Plasmin in turn degrades the fibrin matrix of the thrombus, thereby exerting its thrombolytic action. This helps eliminate blood clots or arterial blockages that cause myocardial infarction. Mechanism of action: Streptokinase cleaves the Arg\/Val bond in plasminogen to form plasmin. Plasmin degrades fibrin clots as well as fibrinogen and other plasma proteins. This in turn leads to the degradation of blood clots. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Thrombolytic Agents"}}
