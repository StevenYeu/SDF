It acts by inhibiting sodium channel conduction. Overdose can lead to headache, tinnitus, numbness and tingling around the mouth and tongue, convulsions, inability to breathe, and decreased heart function. Pharmacology: Hexylcaine is a local ester-class anesthetic. Local anesthetics produce a transient block of nerve conduction by interfering with sodium channels. This effect of the anesthetic interferes with the development of an action potential across the nerve. Mechanism of action: Hexyl caine acts mainly by inhibiting sodium influx through voltage gated sodium channels in the neuronal cell membrane of peripheral nerves. When the influx of sodium is interrupted, an action potential cannot arise and signal conduction is thus inhibited. The receptor site is thought to be located at the cytoplasmic (inner) portion of the sodium channel. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anesthetics. Local Anesthetics"}}
