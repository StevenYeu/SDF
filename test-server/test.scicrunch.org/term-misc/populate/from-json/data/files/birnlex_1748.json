It is the predominant cytoarchitectural component of the occipital lobe and is cytoarchitecturally homologous to striate area 17 of the human. Topographically it occupies a much greater proportion of the cerebral cortex in the monkey than in the human. Indeed, the single largest cytoarchitectural area in the monkey, it is the only cortical area in the monkey that is larger in absolute terms than its human homologue (Brodmann-1909). Distinctive features (Brodmann-1905): area 17 is relatively narrow in total thickness, the cellular layers are distinct, and cells are generally small, numerous and densely packed; the molecular layer (I) is thin and cell-free; the external granular layer is poorly developed and its boundary with the external pyramidal layer (III) is indistinct; the latter is extremely thin with a few larger pyramidal cells distributed in its deeper portion; the internal granular layer (IV) is very prominent and divided into three sublayers. 4a, 4b and 4c; subayer 4a is composed of densely packed granule cells with sparsely distributed stellate and pyramidal cells; sublayer 4b, which corresponds to the band of Gennari in myelin-stained sections, is a broad clear stripe with a string of isolated large cells distributed along its center; sublayer 4c, the darkest stained sublayer, is composed of the most densely packed cells; it can, in turn be subdivided into an outer denser portion that contains granule cells and larger polymorphic cells and an inner sparser portion composed entirely of granule cells; the internal pyramidal layer (V) is the least cellular, clearest layer with large pyramidal cells, i.e., solitary cells of Meynert, distributed along its border with the multiform layer (VI); the latter consists of two sublayers, 6a and 6b; sublayer 6a is darker stained with larger cells; sublayer 6b is lighter stained with spindle cells; the boundary between the multiform layer and the subcortical white matter is distinct."}}
