They project to the superior olivary nuclei. They carry information that is used to localize sounds in the azimuthal plane.  Three types of bushy cells differ in the shapes of their somata and in their patterns of projection.  The cell somata of these neurons have been described as \"spherical\" in the anterior division of the AVCN and \"globular\" in the posterior division of the AVCN.  Large spherical bushy cells project to the medial superior olivary nuclei bilaterally, globular bushy cells project to the contralateral medial nucleus of the trapezoid body.  Small spherical bushy cells project to the vicinity of the ipsilateral lateral superior olivary nucleus but it is not yet clear which cells are their targets.  Their inputs from the spiral (cochlear) ganglion arise via the end bulbs of Held."}}
