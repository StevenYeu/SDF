(PubChem) Pharmacology: Ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antiinfective agent of the fluoroquinolone class. Ciprofloxacin has in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms. The mechanism of action of quinolones, including ciprofloxacin, is different from that of other antimicrobial agents such as beta-lactams, macrolides, tetracyclines, or aminoglycosides; therefore, organisms resistant to these drugs may be susceptible to ciprofloxacin. There is no known cross-resistance between ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobials. Notably the drug has 100 times higher affinity for bacterial DNA gyrase than for mammalian. Mechanism of action: The bactericidal action of ciprofloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Infective Agents. Anti-Infectives. Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors. Quinolones"}}
