{"Fluorescent protein":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Protein","Id":"nlx_mol_20090607","Definition":"Protein that possesses native fluorescence.  Naturally occuring fluorescent proteins include green fluroescent protein, originally isolated from the jellyfish.  Other colors of fluorescent proteins were produced through mutations, e.g., the Yellow fluorescent protein.  These proteins are used extensively as biosensors through fusion of gene for the fluorescent protein to a target protein.  "}}
