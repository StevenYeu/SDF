The cell body fiber ascends through the median bundle to the level of the gamma lobe, and then projects towards the tip of the alpha lobe where it forms extensive arborization. On the way to the alpha lobe, several fibers branch off with some arborizing in the superior neuropils, and others arborize in this region before turning anteriorly and terminating in the anterior dorsal superior medial protocerebrum.","hasDBXref":"FlyBrain_NDB:10463"}}
