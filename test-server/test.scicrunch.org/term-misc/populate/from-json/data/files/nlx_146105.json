In Test A these items are numbers (1,2,3 etc.) and the order is determined by increasing magnitude. In Test B these items are both numbers and letters (1,2,3, A,B,C etc.) and the order is determined by a combination of increasing numbers AND letters (e.g., 1 A 2 B 3 C..) requiring participants to alternate between letters and numbers."}}
