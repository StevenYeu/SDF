It is used in parkinson disease to reduce peripheral adverse effects of levodopa. It has no antiparkinson actions by itself. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Carbidopa, a noncompetitive decarboxylase inhibitor, is used in combination with levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Mechanism of action: When mixed with levodopa, carbidopa inhibits the peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine and the decarboxylation of oxitriptan to serotonin by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. This results in increased amount of levodopa and oxitriptan available for transport to the CNS. Carbidopa also inhibits the metabolism of levodopa in the GI tract, thus, increasing the bioavailability of levodopa. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antidyskinetics. Antiparkinson Agents. Dopamine Agents. Enzyme Inhibitors"}}
