CA3 IS-I neurons are visualized for CR and occur in all subfields of hippocampus and dentate gyrus. The CA3 IS-I cells has soma located in strata radiatum, oriens and pyramidale. The dendritic tree arborizes extensively in stratum radiatum but may also invade other layers. The characteristic feature of these dendrites is that they from long dendrodendritic junctions with each other. The main axons ramify in stratum radiatum, where they emit several collaterals that course in all directions."}}
