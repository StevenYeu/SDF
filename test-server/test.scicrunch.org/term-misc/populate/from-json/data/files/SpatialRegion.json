This view of space is sometimes called \"absolutist\" or \"the container view\". In BFO","the class site (snap:Site) allows for a so-called relational view of space","that is to say","a view according to which spatiality is a matter of relative location between entities and not a matter of being tied to space. The bridge between these two views is secured through the fact that while instances of site (snap:Site) are not spatial region (snap:SpatialRegion) entities","they are nevertheless spatial entities.","Examples: the sum total of all space in the universe","parts of the sum total of all space in the universe","Comment: All instances of continuant (snap:Continuant) are spatial entities","that is","they enter in the relation of (spatial) location with spatial region (snap:SpatialRegion) entities. As a particular case","the exact spatial location of a spatial region (snap:SpatialRegion) is this region itself.","Comment: An instance of spatial region (snap:SpatialRegion) is a part of space. All parts of space are spatial region (snap:SpatialRegion) entities and only spatial region (snap:SpatialRegion) entities are parts of space.
