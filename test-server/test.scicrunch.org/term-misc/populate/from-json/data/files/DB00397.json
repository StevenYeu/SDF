In November 2000, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a public health advisory against the use of the drug. Pharmacology: Phenylpropanolamine (PPA), a sympathomimetic agent structurally similar to pseudoephedrine, is used to treat nasal congestion. Phenylpropanolamine is found in appetite suppressant formulations and with guaifenesinin in cough-cold formulations. In 2000, the FDA requested that all drug companies discontinue marketing products containing phenylpropanolamine, due to an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke in women who used phenylpropanolamine. Mechanism of action: Phenylpropanolamine acts directly on alpha- and, to a lesser degree, beta-adrenergic receptors in the mucosa of the respiratory tract. Stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors produces vasoconstriction, reduces tissue hyperemia, edema, and nasal congestion, and increases nasal airway patency. PPA indirectly stimulates beta-receptors, producing tachycardia and a positive inotropic effect. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Withdrawn. Drug category: Adrenergic alpha-Agonists.
