(Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Emedastine is a relatively selective H1-receptor antagonist. Mechanism of action: Emedastine is a relatively selective, histamine H1 antagonist. In vitro examinations of emedastine's affinity for histamine receptors demonstrate relative selectivity for the H1 histamine receptor. In vivo studies have shown concentration-dependent inhibition of histamine-stimulated vascular permeability in the conjunctiva following topical ocular administration. Emedastine appears to be devoid of effects on adrenergic, dopaminergic and serotonin receptors. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Allergic Agents. Histamine H1 Antagonists"}}
