On January 31, 2006, ranolazine was approved for use in the United States by the FDA for the treatment of chronic angina. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Ranolazine has antianginal and anti-ischemic effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It is the first new anti-anginal developed in over 20 years. Mechanism of action: The mechanism of action of ranolazine is unknown. It does not increase the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. In vitro studies suggest that ranolazine is a P-gp inhibitor. Ranolazine is believed to have its effects via altering the trans-cellular late sodium current. It is by altering the intracellular sodium level that ranolazine affects the sodium-dependent calcium channels during myocardial ischemia. Thus, ranolazine indirectly prevents the calcium overload that causes cardiac ischemia. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Enzyme Inhibitors"}}
