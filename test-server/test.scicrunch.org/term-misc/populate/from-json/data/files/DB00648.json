It is used to treat adrenocortical tumors and causes CNS damage, but no bone marrow depression. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Mitotane is an oral chemotherapeutic agent indicated in the treatment of inoperable adrenal cortical carcinoma of both functional and nonfunctional types. Mitotane can best be described as an adrenal cytotoxic agent, although it can cause adrenal inhibition, apparently without cellular destruction. The administration of Mitotane alters the extra-adrenal metabolism of cortisol in man; leading to a reduction in measurable 17-hydroxy corticosteroids, even though plasma levels of corticosteroids do not fall. The drug apparently causes increased formation of 6-B-hydroxyl cortisol. Mechanism of action: Its biochemical mechanism of action is unknown, although data are available to suggest that the drug modifies the peripheral metabolism of steroids as well as directly suppressing the adrenal cortex. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antineoplastic Agents. Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal"}}
