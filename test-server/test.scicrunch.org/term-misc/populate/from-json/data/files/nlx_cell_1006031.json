They are not positive for PV and VIP. Characteristically these neurons has a round cell body and short, non-spiny dendrites that were arranged in a stellate patterns around the cell body, spatially localized to the SLM, and often enter the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. The axons are branched profusely close to soma occupying greater area than dendrites, like dendrites axons also tend to occupy mainly the SLM, often traveling fairly long distances along the SLM axis and mostly even entering the neighboring molecular layer of the dentate gyrus."}}
