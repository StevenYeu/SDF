{"Alpha-Synuclein Protein":{"IsPartOfPMID":"9726379","Synonym":["NACP"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Synuclein Protein","Id":"sao5651809446","Is part of":["Lewy Body"],"Definition":"Predominantly a presynaptic neuronal protein of unknown function, but can also be found in glial cells.  Expressed particularly in the neocortex, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum. It is normally an unstructured protein yet it can aggregate to form incoluble fibrils in pathological conditions characterized by Lewy bodies.  It is the primary structural component of Lewy body fibrils and an alpha-synuclein fragment, known as the non-ABeta component (NAC) is found in amyloid plaques."}}
