{"Flecainide":{"RelatedTo":"Sodium channel protein type 5 subunit alpha","Synonym":["Flecainida (INN-Spanish)","Flecainide acetate","Flecainidum (INN-Latin)","Flecaine"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB01195","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB01195","Definition":"A potent anti-arrhythmia agent, effective in a wide range of ventricular and atrial arrhythmias and tachycardias. Paradoxically, however, in myocardial infarct patients with either symptomatic or asymptomatic arrhythmia, flecainide exacerbates the arrhythmia and is not recommended for use in these patients. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Flecainide has local anesthetic activity and belongs to the membrane stabilizing (Class 1) group of antiarrhythmic agents; it has electrophysiologic effects characteristic of the IC class of antiarrhythmics. Mechanism of action: Flecainide acts on sodium channels on the neuronal cell membrane, limiting the spread of seizure activity and reducing seizure propagation. The antiarrhythmic actions are mediated through effects on sodium channels in Purkinje fibers. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Arrhythmia Agents. Antiarrhythmic Agents"}}
