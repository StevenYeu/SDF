Olsalazine is a derivative of salicylic acid. Inactive by itself (it is a prodrug), it is converted by the bacteria in the colon to mesalamine. Mesalamine works as an anti-inflammatory agent in treating inflammatory diseases of the intestines. Pharmacology: Olsalazine is an anti-inflammatory drug used in the treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Olsalazine reduces the bowel inflammation, diarrhea (stool frequency), rectal bleeding, and abdominal pain. Like Balsalazide, Olsalazine is believed to deliver Mesalazine, or 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), past the small intestine, directly to the large intestine, which is that active site of disease in ulcerative colitis. Mechanism of action: Orally administered olsalazine is converted to mesalamine which is thought to be the therapeutically active agent in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. The mechanism of action of mesalamine (and sulfasalazine) is unknown, but appears to be topical rather than systemic. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes (LTs) and hydroxyelcosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin (PG) production in the colon. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal. Gastrointestinal Agents"}}
