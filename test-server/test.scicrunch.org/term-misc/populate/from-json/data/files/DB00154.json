It differs from arachidonic acid, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid, only at position 5. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Dihomo gamma-linolenic acid or DHLA is an n-6 (omega-6) polyunsaturated fatty acid. It is comprised of 20 carbon atoms and three double bonds. DHLA is a byproduct of the 18 carbon gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). DHLA is then converted into prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). PGE1 inhibits platelet aggregation and also exerts a vasodilatory effect. Mechanism of action: DHLA (or DGLA) is a precursor in the synthesis of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) as well as the series-3 prostaglandins. It also serves as a precursor in the synthesis of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). EPA is a precursor of the series-3 prostaglandins, the series-5 leukotrienes and the series-3 thromboxanes. These eicosanoids have anti-thrombogenic, anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic properties. PGE1 inhibits platelet aggregation and has a vasodilation action. DHLA has also been shown to reduce the production\/activity of tumor necrosis factor alpha. Drug type: Approved. Nutraceutical. Small Molecule. Drug category: Dietary supplement. Micronutrient"}}
