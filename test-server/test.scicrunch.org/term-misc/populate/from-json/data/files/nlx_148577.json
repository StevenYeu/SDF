A neurite projects dorsolaterally and forms arborizations further in the inferior neuropils and within the superior neuropils. Some of these branches extend ventromedially and arborize in the medial-most segments of the gamma lobe and the beta-s and beta'-a strata. Some of the fibers further project to the contralateral medial lobes.","hasDBXref":"FlyBrain_NDB:10454"}}
