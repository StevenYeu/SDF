{"Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis":{"Related disease":"Multiple Sclerosis","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Nervous system disease","Id":"nlx_152172","Has role":"Animal model of multiple sclerosis","Abbrev":"EAE","Definition":"Encephalomyelitis induced by inoculation with a white matter emulsion combined with FREUND'S ADJUVANT, myelin basic protein, or purified central myelin.  The innoculation triggers a T cell-mediated immune response directed towards central myelin. The pathologic features are similar to MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, including perivascular and periventricular foci of inflammation and demyelination. Subpial demyelination underlying meningeal infiltrations also occurs, which is also a feature of ENCEPHALOMYELITIS, ACUTE DISSEMINATED. Passive immunization with T-cells from an afflicted animal to a normal animal also induces this condition.
