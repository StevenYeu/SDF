{"Eukaryota":{"Created":"2007-06-03","Synonym":["Eukarya","eucaryotes","Eucaryotae","eukaryote"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","Umlscui":"C0684063","SuperCategory":"Organism","Id":"birnlex_399","Definition":"An organism whose cells contain complex structures enclosed within membranes. Almost all species of large organisms are eukaryotes, including animals, plants and fungi, although most species of eukaryotic protists are microorganisms. The defining membrane-bound structure that sets eukaryotic cells apart from prokaryotic cells is the nucleus. The presence of a nucleus gives eukaryotes their name, which comes from the Greek \u03b5\u03c5 (eu, \"good\", \"noble\" & \"true\") and \u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03c5\u03bf\u03bd (karyon, \"nut\" & \"kernel\"). Most eukaryotic cells contain other membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria, chloroplasts and the Golgi apparatus. (Wikipedia)"}}
