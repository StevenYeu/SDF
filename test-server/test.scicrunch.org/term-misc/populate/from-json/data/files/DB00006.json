Thrombin is a serine proteinase that plays a central role in the thrombotic process, acting to cleave fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and to activate Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa, allowing fibrin to develop a covalently cross-linked framework which stabilizes the thrombus; thrombin also activates Factors V and VIII, promoting further thrombin generation, and activates platelets, stimulating aggregation and granule release Mechanism of action: Inhibits the action of thrombin by binding both to its catalytic site and to its anion-binding exosite. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Anticoagulants. Antithrombotic Agents"}}
