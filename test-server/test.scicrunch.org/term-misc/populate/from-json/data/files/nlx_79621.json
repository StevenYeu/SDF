{"Glaucoma":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Neuropathy","Id":"nlx_79621","Definition":"Group of diseases that affect the optic nerve and involves a loss of retinal ganglion cells in a characteristic pattern.  It is a type of optic neuropathy. Raised intraocular pressure is a significant risk factor for developing glaucoma (above 22 mmHg or 2.9 kPa). One person may develop nerve damage at a relatively low pressure, while another person may have high eye pressure for years and yet never develop damage. Untreated glaucoma leads to permanent damage of the optic nerve and resultant visual field loss, which can progress to blindness. - adapted from Wikipedia"}}
