Its surface can be viewed as an ellipsoid with the white matter of the angular bundle as its center. The entorhinal cortex is hodologically defined by axonal projections from layer II neurons to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. Anteriorly, the entorhinal cortex is flanked by the piriform cortex laterally, and by the periamygdaloid cortex and the posterior cortical nucleus of the amygdala, medially (non-hippocampal regions not further described in this atlas). The transition between the entorhinal cortex and its anterior neighbors is approximately at the midst of the amygdaloid fissure, where the entorhinal cortex progressively decreases in width, such that it eventually extends anteriorly for approximately 2 mm as a narrow strip.  This anterior extension is delimited dorsolaterally by the perirhinal cortex and ventromedially by the piriform cortex. At its laterocaudal site, the entorhinal cortex is surrounded by the perirhinal and postrhinal cortices. Medially, the entorhinal cortex is bordered over most of its rostrocaudal extent by the parasubiculum. It comprises 5 subdivisions; dorsal-lateral entorhinal area (DLE), dorsal-intermediate entorhinal area (DIE), ventral-intermediate entorhinal area (VIE), medial entorhinal area (ME) and caudal entorhinal area (CE).","DefinitionPMID":"21519393"}}
