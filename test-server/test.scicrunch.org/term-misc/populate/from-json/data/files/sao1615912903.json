{"Muller Cell":{"Created":"2007-09-05","Comment":["We classify this differently from the cell type ontology"],"SuperCategory":"Macroglial Cell","Id":"sao1615912903","Definition":"Specialized glial cell of the retina whose processed span the full thickness of the retina.  Its cell body, recognized in electron micrographs by its dark cytoplasm and by its polygonal shape, lies in the deeper regions of the inner nuclear layer.  Its processes reach the choroid layer outwardly and inwardly extend to ensheath the ganglioin cells and terminate on the vitreal surface as endfeet.  (Shepherd, G.
