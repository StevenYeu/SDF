It is produced in an E. coli expression system. Pharmacology: Denileukin diftitox (Ontak) directs the cytocidal action of diphtheria toxin to cells which express the IL-2 receptor. The human IL-2 receptor exists in three forms, low (CD25), intermediate (CD122\/CD132) and high (CD25\/CD122\/CD132) affinity. Malignant cells expressing one or more of the subunits of the IL-2 receptor are found in certain leukemias and lymphomas including cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Ontak interacts with the high affinity IL-2 receptor on the cell surface and inhibits cellular protein synthesis, resulting in cell death within hours. Mechanism of action: Denileukin diftitox binds to the high-affinity IL-2 receptor complex. The IL-2 receptor (Tac) subunit is expressed on activated but not resting lymphocytes. The diphtheria toxin associated with Ontak then selectively kills the IL-2 bearing cells. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Antineoplastic Agents"}}
