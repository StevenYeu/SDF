(PubChem) Pharmacology: Sotalol is an antiarrhythmic drug. It falls into the class of beta blockers (and class II antiarrhythmic agents) because of its primary action on the -adrenergic receptors in the heart. In addition to its actions on the beta receptors in the heart, sotalol inhibits the inward potassium ion channels of the heart. In so doing, sotalol prolongs repolarization, therefore lengthening the QT interval and decreasing automaticity. It also slows atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction. Because of these actions on the cardiac action potential, it is also considered a class III antiarrhythmic agent. The beta-blocking effect of sotalol is non-cardioselective, half maximal at about 80mg\/day and maximal at doses between 320 and 640 mg\/day. Sotalol does not have partial agonist or membrane stabilizing activity. Although significant beta-blockade occurs at oral doses as low as 25 mg, significant Class Ieffects are seen only at daily doses of 160 mg and above. Mechanism of action: Sotalol has both beta-adrenoreceptor blocking (Vaughan Williams Class I) and cardiac action potential duration prolongation (Vaughan Williams Class I) antiarrhythmic properties. Sotalol is a racemic mixture of d- and l-sotalol. Both isomers have similar Class I antiarrhythmic effects, while the l-isomer is responsible for virtually all of the beta-blocking activity.
