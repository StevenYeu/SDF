Thyroxine is synthesized via the iodination of tyrosines (monoiodotyrosine) and the coupling of iodotyrosines (diiodotyrosine) in the thyroglobulin. Thyroxine is released from thyroglobulin by proteolysis and secreted into the blood. Thyroxine is peripherally deiodinated to form triiodothyronine which exerts a broad spectrum of stimulatory effects on cell metabolism. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Dextrothyroxine, the dextrorotary isomer of the synthetic thyroxine, is a antihyperlipidemic. Mechanism of action: Dextrothyroxine is a antihyperlipidemic. The mechanism of action is not completely understood, but dextrothyroxine apparently acts in the liver to stimulate formation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and, to a much greater extent, to increase catabolism of LDL. This leads to increased excretion of cholesterol and bile acids via the biliary route into the feces, with a resulting reduction in serum cholesterol and LDL. Dextrothyroxine has no significant effect on high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antihyperlipidemics"}}
