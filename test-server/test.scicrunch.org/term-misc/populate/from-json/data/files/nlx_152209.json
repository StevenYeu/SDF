{"MTT assay":{"RelatedTo":["Cell proliferation"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Assay","Id":"nlx_152209","Definition":"A colorimetric assay for measuring the activity of cellular enzymes that reduce the tetrazolium dye, MTT, to its insoluble formazan, giving a purple color. These assays measure cellular metabolic activity via NAD(P)H-dependent cellular oxidoreductase enzymes and may, under defined conditions, reflect the number of viable cells (cell proliferation). Tetrazolium dye assays can also be used to measure cytotoxicity (loss of viable cells) or cytostatic activity (shift from proliferative to resting status) of potential medicinal agents and toxic materials.
