It speeds gastrointestinal peristalsis, causes prolactin release, and is used as antiemetic and tool in the study of dopaminergic mechanisms. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Domperidone is a specific blocker of dopamine receptors. It speeds gastrointestinal peristalsis, causes prolactin release, and is used as antiemetic and tool in the study of dopaminergic mechanisms. Mechanism of action: Gastrointestinal emptying (delayed) adjunct; peristaltic stimulant: The gastroprokinetic properties of domperidone are related to its peripheral dopamine receptor blocking properties. Domperidone facilitates gastric emptying and decreases small bowel transit time by increasing esophageal and gastric peristalsis and by lowering esophageal sphincter pressure. Antiemetic: The antiemetic properties of domperidone are related to its dopamine receptor blocking activity at both the chemoreceptor trigger zone and at the gastric level. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antiemetics. Dopamine Antagonists"}}
