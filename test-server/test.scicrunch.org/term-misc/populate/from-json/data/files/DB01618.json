Molindone has much lower affinity for D2 receptors than most antipsychotic agents and has a relatively low affinity for D1 receptors. It has only low to moderate affinity for cholinergic and alpha-adrenergic receptors. Some electrophysiologic data from animals indicate that molindone has certain characteristics that resemble those of clozapine. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p283) Pharmacology: Molindone is a dihydroindolone compound which is not structurally related to the phenothiazines, the butyrophenones or the thioxanthenes. Molindone has a pharmacological profile in laboratory animals which predominantly resembles that of major tranquilizers causing reduction of spontaneous locomotion and aggressiveness, suppression of a conditioned response and antagonism of the bizarre stereotyped behavior and hyperactivity induced by amphetamines. In addition, molindone antagonizes the depression caused by the tranquilizing agent tetrabenazine. Mechanism of action: The exact mechanism has not been established, however, based on electroencephalogram (EEG) studies, molindone is thought to act by occupying dopamine (D2) receptor sites in the reticular activating and limbic systems in the brain, thus decreasing dopamine activity. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antipsychotic Agents"}}
