It is called a thiazide-like diuretic but structure is different enough (lacking the thiazo-ring) so it is not clear that the mechanism is comparable. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Indapamide is an antihypertensive and a diuretic. It contains both a polar sulfamoyl chlorobenzamide moiety and a lipid- soluble methylindoline moiety. Indapamide bears a structural similarity to the triazide diuretics which are known to decrease vascular smooth muscle reactivity. However, it differs chemically from the thiazides in that it does not possess the thiazide ring system and contains only one sulfonamide group. Indapamide appears to cause vasodilation, probably by inhibiting the passage of calcium and other ions (sodium, potassium) across membranes. This same effect may cause hypokalcemia in susceptible individuals. Indapamide has also been shown to cause uterine myometrial relaxation in experimental animals. Overall, indapamide has an extra-renal antihypertensive action resulting in a decrease in vascular hyperreactivity and a reduction in total peripheral and arteriolar resistance. Mechanism of action: Indapamide blocks the slow component of delayed rectifier potassium current (IKs) without altering the rapid component (IKr) or the inward rectifier current. Specifically it blocks or antagonizes the action the proteins KCNQ1 and KCNE1. Indapamide is also thought to stimulate the synthesis of the vasodilatory hypotensive prostaglandin PGE2. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antihypertensive Agents. Diuretics"}}
