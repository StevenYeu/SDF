{"Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor":{"RelatedTo":["Glutamate"],"Synonym":["mGluRs","GRM","Glutamate metabotropic"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"G-protein_coupled_receptor","Id":"nlx_mol_20090503","Has role":"Glutamate receptor,","Abbrev":"mGluR","Definition":"The metabotropic glutamate receptors, or mGluRs, are a type of glutamate receptor which are active through an indirect metabotropic process. They are members of the group C family of G-protein-coupled receptors, or GPCRs, and are divided into 3 groups based on sequence homology and binding affinities. Like all glutamate receptors, mGluRs bind to glutamate, an amino acid that functions as an excitatory neurotransmitter.Group I mGluR's are coupled to phospholipid metabolism and comprise members 1 and 5Group II mGluR's are coupled to reduced cAMP turnover and comprise members 2, 3 and 4Group III mGluR's are coupled to reduced cAMP turnover and comprise members 6, 7, and 8"}}
