It also has weak beta-blocking activity. The drug is generally well tolerated. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Propafenone is a Class 1C antiarrhythmic drug with local anesthetic effects, and a direct stabilizing action on myocardial membranes. It is used in the treatment of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. It works by slowing the influx of sodium ions into the cardiac muscle cells, causing a decrease in excitablity of the cells. Propafenone has local anesthetic activity approximately equal to procaine. Mechanism of action: The electrophysiological effect of propafenone manifests itself in a reduction of upstroke velocity (Phase 0) of the monophasic action potential. In Purkinje fibers, and to a lesser extent myocardial fibers, propafenone reduces the fast inward current carried by sodium ions, which is responsible for the drugs antiarrhythmic actions. Diastolic excitability threshold is increased and effective refractory period prolonged. Propafenone reduces spontaneous automaticity and depresses triggered activity. At very high concentrations in vitro, propafenone can inhibit the slow inward current carried by calcium but this calcium antagonist effect probably does not contribute to antiarrhythmic efficacy. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Arrhythmia Agents"}}
