The drug increases arterial oxygen tension while decreasing arterial carbon dioxide tension in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It may also prove useful in the treatment of nocturnal oxygen desaturation without impairing the quality of sleep. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Almitrine is a respiratory stimulant that enhances respiration by acting as an agonist of peripheral chemoreceptors located on the carotid bodies. The drug increases arterial oxygen tension while decreasing arterial carbon dioxide tension in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It may also prove useful in the treatment of nocturnal oxygen desaturation without impairing the quality of sleep. Mechanism of action: Almitrine enhances respiration by acting as an agonist of peripheral chemoreceptors located on the carotid bodies. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Respiratory System Agents"}}
