{"Brodmann 1909 area 4 human":{"Synonym":"Brodmann's area 4","CurationStatus":"uncurated","PartiallyOverlapsWith":"primary motor cortex","NeuronamesID":"2394","SuperCategory":"Brodmann partition scheme region","Id":"nlx_143609","ParcellationScheme":"Brodmann (1909) cortical parcellation scheme human","Is part of":["Frontal cortex"],"Species":"Human","Definition":"Brodmann area comprising a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined precentral region of the precentral gyrus in human. Cytoarchitecturally the caudal boundary with the area 3 of Brodmann (human) does not coincide precisely with the floor of the central sulcus but lies variably in the banks of the postcentral gyrus and the precentral gyrus. The area also does not extend in all cases to the cingulate sulcus medially or to the end of the central sulcus ventrolaterally. It is bounded rostrally by the area 6 of Brodmann (human) ( Brodmann-1909) (adapted from Brain Info)."}}
