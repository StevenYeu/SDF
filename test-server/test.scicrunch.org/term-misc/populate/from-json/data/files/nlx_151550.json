{"Optic Pathways of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["optic p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151550","Is part of":"Major White Matter Structures of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"The optic pathways are very easy to segment on coronal T2-weighted MRI. This pathway, comprised of optic nerves, optic chiasm, and optic tracts, is comprised largely of densely packed, myelinated axons, which appear quite dark on T2 MRI. The entire pathway can be segmented by simple seeded thresholding (magic wand) with a seed placed in the optic chiasm. The dorsal and caudal most extent of the optic tracts as the course lateral to the diencephalon can become quite thin, and may be difficult to distinguish depending on image resolution."}}
