dkNET searches across webpages and databases that provide access to research resources of interest to NIDDK researchers. dkNET has selected a subset of these resource providers as "Community Resources", that is, resources that were specifically created for the dkNET community, e.g. GUDMAP, or contain information of particular importance to NIDDK Researchers, e.g. the Antibody Registry. "Community Resources" were currently pre-selected for inclusion by the NIDDK Information Network Steering Committee. A list of the currently Community Resources can be found <a href="https://dknet.org/about/sources">here</a>.
