This class is commonly used in generating a type of emotion linked to a specific memory.  This class does NOT include tasks which probe semantic memory (memory of facts or concepts) in which subjects are asked to recall stimuli that were memorized prior to scanning - those are coded as Cued Explicit Recognition."}}
