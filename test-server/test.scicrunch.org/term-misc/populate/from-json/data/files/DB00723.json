It has little if any direct effect on the central nervous system. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Methoxamine is a potent sympathomimetic amine that increases both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Methoxamine is indicated for prevention and treatment of the acute hypotensive state occurring with spinal anesthesia. It is also indicated as adjunctive treatment of hypotension due to hemorrhage, reactions to medications, surgical complications, and shock associated with brain damage due to trauma or tumor. Methoxamine acts on both 1-adrenergic receptors but appears to have no effect on -adrenergic receptors. It acts by increasing the force of the heart's pumping action as well as constricting peripheral blood vessels. Mechanism of action: Methoxamine acts through peripheral vasoconstriction by acting as a pure alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist, consequently increasing systemic blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic). Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Adrenergic alpha-Agonists. Sympathomimetics. Vasoconstrictor Agents"}}
