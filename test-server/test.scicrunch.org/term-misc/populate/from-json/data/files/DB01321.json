The drug has antimicrobial activity against a wide spectrum of pathogens. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Josamycin is a macrolide antibiotic from Streptomyces narbonensis. The drug has antimicrobial activity against a wide spectrum of pathogens. Mechanism of action: The mechanism of action of macrolides such as Josamycin is via inhibition of bacterial protein biosynthesis by binding reversibly to the subunit 50S of the bacterial ribosome, thereby inhibiting translocation of peptidyl tRNA. This action is mainly bacteriostatic, but can also be bactericidal in high concentrations. Macrolides tend to accumulate within leukocytes, and are therefore actually transported into the site of infection. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents. Antibacterial Agents. Macrolides"}}
