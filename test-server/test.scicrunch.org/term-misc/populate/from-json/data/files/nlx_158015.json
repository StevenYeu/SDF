{"Ground state depletion microscopy":{"EditorialNote":"Trying to consolidate the assay and protocol branch, as it leads to unnecessary duplication.  Decided to go with protocol","CurationStatus":"graph position temporary","SuperCategory":"Optical imaging protocol","Curator":["Maryann Martone"],"Id":"nlx_158015","Has role":"Super-resolution microscopy","Abbrev":"GSD","Definition":"A type of microscopy that uses the triplet state of a fluorophore as the off-state and the singlet state as the on-state, whereby an excitation laser is used to drive the fluorophores at the periphery of the singlet state molecule to the triplet state.
