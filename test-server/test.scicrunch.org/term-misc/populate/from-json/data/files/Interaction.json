{"Interaction":{"Synonym":"Interaction type,","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Entity","PublicationLink":"http:\/\/www.biopax.org\/release\/biopax-level3.owl#Interaction","Id":"Interaction","Xref":"BioPAX Interaction","Definition":"A biological relationship between two or more entities. Rationale: BioPAX interactions are atomic from modeling perspective, i.e. it is not possible to define sub-interactions. For representing non-atomic continuants with explicit subevents, pathway class should be used. Interactions does not have to be temporally atomic though, for example genetic interactions cover a large span of time. Usage: Interaction is a highly abstract class and in almost all cases it is more appropriate to use subclasses of interaction. It is partially possible to define generic reactions by using generic participants. A more comprehensive method is planned for BioPAX L4 for covering all generic cases like oxidization of a generic alcohol. Synonyms: Process, relationship, event. Examples: protein-protein interaction, biochemical reaction, enzyme catalysis. Taken from BioPAX"}}
