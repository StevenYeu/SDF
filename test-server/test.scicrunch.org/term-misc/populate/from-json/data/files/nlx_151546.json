{"Cingulum of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["cingulum p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151546","Is part of":"Major White Matter Structures of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"The cingulum is easily segmented on coronal T2-weighted MRI and\/or a directionally encoded color fractional anisotropy image if one exists. On T2-weighted MRI the cingulum is a dark crescentic structure just dorsal to the corpus callosum. The dorsal border with the much brighter appearing cortex is straightforward. The ventral border with the corpus callosum is defined by a fine, bright line that fades laterally as the two structures merge. This border is trivially easy to distinguish on color fractional anisotropy images as these two white matter tracts course virtually perpendicular to each other. The rostral extent of the cingulum is a small sliver just medial to the forceps minor of the corpus callosum. The caudal extent is a semicircular shell around the medial aspect of the forceps major of the corpus callosum."}}
