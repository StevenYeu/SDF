{"Septum of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["septum p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151538","Is part of":"Subpallium of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"The septum can be segmented on coronal diffusion-weighted images (DWI). The rostral-most portion of the septum (the navicular nucleus) appears as a light (low diffusivity), boat-shaped patch just medial to the slightly darker (higher diffusivity) and circular accumbens nucleus. Moving caudally, this light region moves medially and dorsally becoming a light, vertical band that eventually merges with the lateral septal nuclei. The main portion of the septum is bounded laterally by a thin slit of lateral ventricle and dorsally by the much darker corpus callosum. The ventral border with the preoptic area is subtle. A horizontal line connecting the ventral extent of the anterior limbs of the anterior commissure roughly approximates this border. Further caudal, the fimbria\/fornix appears as a dark, vertical band in the center of the relatively light septum. The border between the septum and fimbria is easily distinguishable on DWI where white matter tends to be much darker than nuclei. The caudal-most extent of the septum is a light, crescentic region just dorsal to the darker ventral hippocampal commissure."}}
