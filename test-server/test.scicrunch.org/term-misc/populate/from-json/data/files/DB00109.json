N-terminal acetylated, C-terminal amide. Pharmacology: Not Available Mechanism of action: Enfuvirtide binds to the first heptad-repeat (HR1) in the gp41 subunit of the viral envelope glycoprotein and prevents the conformational changes required for the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. It works by disrupting the HIV-1 molecular machinery at the final stage of fusion with the target cell, preventing uninfected cells from becoming infected. Enfuvirtide is a biomimetic peptide that was rationally designed to mimic components of the HIV-1 fusion machinery and displace them, preventing normal fusion. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Anti-HIV Agents. HIV Fusion Inhibitors"}}
