It is a fat-soluble vitamin that is stable to air and moisture but decomposes in sunlight. It is found naturally in a wide variety of green plants. Phylloquinone is also an antidote for coumatetralyl. Vitamin K is needed for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly required for blood coagulation. Pharmacology: Phytonadione is a vitamin, indicated in the treatment of coagulation disorders which are due to faulty formation of factors II, VII, IX and X when caused by vitamin K deficiency or interference with vitamin K activity. Phytonadione aqueous colloidal solution of vitamin K1 for parenteral injection, possesses the same type and degree of activity as does naturally-occurring vitamin K, which is necessary for the production via the liver of active prothrombin (factor II), proconvertin (factor VII), plasma thromboplastin component (factor IX), and Stuart factor (factor X). Mechanism of action: Vitamin K is an essential cofactor for the gamma-carboxylase enzymes which catalyze the posttranslational gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues in inactive hepatic precursors of coagulation factors II, VII, IX and X. Gamma-carboxylation converts these inactive precursors into active coagulation factors which are secreted by hepatocytes into the blood. Supplementing with Phytonadione results in a relief of vitamin K deficiency symptoms which include easy bruisability, epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, menorrhagia and hematuria.
