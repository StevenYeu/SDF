Each number is displayed onscreen for one second and, if the subject presses a button while that number is displayed, he-she receives that number of points along with immediate positive visual and auditory feedback.  When a 40 or 80 appears, however, there is a chance that it will appear in an alternate color, along with immediate negative feedback signaling a loss of 40 or 80 points, respectively.  When this occurs, the trial ends immediately (i.e. the subject may not make a response)."}}
