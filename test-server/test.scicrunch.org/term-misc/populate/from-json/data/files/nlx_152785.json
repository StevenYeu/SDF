{"Academic Free License":{"Synonym":["Academic Free License 3.0"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Open-source license","Id":"nlx_152785","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/opensource.org\/licenses\/AFL-3.0","Abbrev":"AFL","Definition":"An open source license, identical to Open Source License (OSL) 3.0 except for the reciprocal source code obligation: Under AFL 3.0, Derivative Works of AFL 3.0-licensed Original Works can be licensed under other licenses, and the Source Code of those Derivative Works need not be disclosed. In effect, then, AFL 3.0 is like the BSD license, with no reciprocal obligation to disclose source code. AFL 3.0 differs materially from OSL 3.0 only in that important underlined half-sentence in \u00a7 1(c), which now authorizes distribution \"under any license of your choice that does not contradict the terms and conditions, including Licensor's reserved rights and remedies, in this Academic Free License.\" In all other material respects, AFL 3.0 uses all the same definitions and, except for reciprocity, can be interpreted the same way as OSL 3.0.
