{"Ionotropic Glutamate Receptor":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Glutamate receptor","Id":"nlx_mol_20090501","Definition":"Cell-surface proteins that bind glutamate and trigger changes which influence the behavior of cells. Ionotropic glutamate receptors include AMPA, kainate, often referred to as AMPA\/kainate or A\/K receptors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.  These receptors directly control ion channels, and are the most common mediators of fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system.  NMDA receptors have also been implicated in the mechanisms of memory and of many diseases."}}
