{"Glass Electrode":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Electrode","Id":"nlx_75417","Has role":"Instrument_role","Definition":"A glass electrode is a type of ion-selective electrode made of a doped glass membrane that is sensitive to a specific ion. It is an important part of the instrumentation for chemical analysis and physico-chemical studies. In modern practice, widely used membranous ion-selective electrodes (ISE, including glasses) are part of a galvanic cell. The electric potential of the electrode system in solution is sensitive to changes in the content of a certain type of ions, which is reflected in the dependence of the electromotive force (EMF) of galvanic element concentrations of these ions.
