From Rexed:  \"[Lamina V] goes straight between the medial and the lateral side of the dorsal horn. It has fewer cells than layers I to IV and more and thicker nerve fibers are running through it. In the lateral part of the 5th layer the fiber bundles are large and numerous and often give the section a reticulated appearance. Here also some fairly large nerve cells are found. The lateral part of layer V corresponds to the formatio reticularis."}}
