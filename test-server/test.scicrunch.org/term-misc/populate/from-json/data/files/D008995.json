{"MAO":{"Synonym":["MAO-B; Amine:oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating) (flavin-containing); Oxidase","Monoamine; Oxidase"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Protein","Id":"D008995","Is part of":["Catecholamine system"],"Definition":"An enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of naturally occurring monoamines. It is a flavin-containing enzyme that is localized in mitochondrial membranes, whether in nerve terminals, the liver, or other organs. Monoamine oxidase is important in regulating the metabolic degradation of catecholamines and serotonin in neural or target tissues. Hepatic monoamine oxidase has a crucial defensive role in inactivating circulating monoamines or those, such as tyramine, that originate in the gut and are absorbed into the portal circulation.
