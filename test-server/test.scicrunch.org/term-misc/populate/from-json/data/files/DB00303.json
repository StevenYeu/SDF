It is structurally very similar to meropenem in that it possess a 1-beta-methyl group. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Ertapenem has in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Mechanism of action: The bactericidal activity of ertapenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through ertapenem binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). In Escherichia coli, it has strong affinity toward PBPs 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4 and 5 with preference for PBPs 2 and 3. Ertapenem is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases. Ertapenem is hydrolyzed by metallo-beta-lactamases. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents. Antibacterial Agents"}}
