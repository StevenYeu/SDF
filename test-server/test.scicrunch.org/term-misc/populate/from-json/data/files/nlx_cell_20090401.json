It resembles the granule cell in the main olfactory bulb, including the lack of an axon.  Each cell gives rise to short central dendrites and a single long apical dendrite that traverses the granule cell layer, pierces the mitral cell body layer, and branches and terminates within the external plexiform layer among the lateral dendrites of mitral and tufted cells.  The dendrites receive synaptic input from mitral and tufted cell dendrites, and have synaptic outputs to those dendrites through reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses.  Shepherd, Chen, Greer.

The AOB granule cells are replaced in the adult through ongoing neurogenesis in the subventricular zone"}}
