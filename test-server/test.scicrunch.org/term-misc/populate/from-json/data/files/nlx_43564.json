{"PONS reference structure":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Project role","Id":"nlx_43564","Definition":"A brain structure that is identified generally within one or more species of animals that forms the basis of communication about brain anatomy among neuroscientists, i.e., is universally used and is typically not subject to explicit referencing in most articles and textbooks except when giving the history. These brain parts are used by neuroscientists and are taught within most introductory neuroanatomy courses to introduce students to the terminology of the domain.   Most are derived from historical gross anatomical studies of the nervous system and are poorly defined in terms of actual boundaries.  Many also have poor relations to functionally defined brain regions.  We distinguish these structure from \"parcels\", which are defined by a particular technique, with explicit criteria for definition and by a particular individual or group.  Reference to parcels typically include a specific citation. "}}
