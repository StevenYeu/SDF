It is known as a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic. Zaleplon interacts with the GABA receptor complex and shares some of the pharmacological properties of the benzodiazepines. Zaleplon is a schedule IV drug in the United States. Pharmacology: Zaleplon is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic from the pyrazolopyrimidine class and is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. While Zaleplon is a hypnotic agent with a chemical structure unrelated to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other drugs with known hypnotic properties, it interacts with the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine (GABABZ) receptor complex. Subunit modulation of the GABABZ receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex is hypothesized to be responsible for some of the pharmacological properties of benzodiazepines, which include sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsive effects in animal models. Zaleplon binds selectively to the brain alpha subunit of the GABA A omega-1 receptor. Mechanism of action: Zaleplon exerts its action through subunit modulation of the GABABZ receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex.Zaleplon binds selectively to the brain alomega-1 receptor situated on the alpha subunit of the GABA-A\/chloride ion channel receptor complex and potentiates t-butyl-bicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding. Drug type: Approved. Illicit. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anticonvulsants. Anxiolytics sedatives and hypnotics. Hypnotics and Sedatives"}}
