(PubChem) Pharmacology: Not Available Mechanism of action: Granisetron is a potent, selective antagonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) subtype 3 (5-HT 3) receptors. 5-HT 3 receptors are present peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the area postrema of the brain. Cytotoxic drugs and radiation damage gastrointestinal mucosa, causing the release of serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal tract. Stimulation of 5-HT 3 receptors causes transmission of sensory signals to the vomiting center via vagal afferent fibers to induce vomiting. By binding to 5-HT 3 receptors, granisetron blocks vomiting mediated by serotonin release. Granisetron has little or no affinity for other serotonin receptors, including 5-HT 1 , 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 1B\/C , or 5-HT 2 ; for alpha 1 -, alpha 2 -, or beta-adrenoreceptors; for dopamine D 2 receptors; for histamine H 1 receptors; for benzodiazepine receptors; for picrotoxin receptors; or for opioid receptors. In most human studies, granisetron has had little effect on blood pressure, heart rate, or electrocardiogram (ECG). Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antiemetics.
