It is the most commonly used rating scale for Parkinsonism in clinical trials over the past 25 years. The ten items focus on rigidity rather than bradykinesia, and do not assess subjective rigidity or slowness. Items are rated for severity on a 0-4 scale, with definitions given for each anchor point."}}
