IGF-1 consists of 70 amino acids in a single chain with three intramolecular disulfide bridges and a molecular weight of 7649 daltons. The amino acid sequence of the product is identical to that of endogenous human IGF-1. The rhIGF-1 protein is synthesized in bacteria (E. coli) that have been modified by the addition of the gene for human IGF-1. Pharmacology: Mecasermin is designed to replace natural IGF-1 in pediatric patients who are deficient, promoting normalized statural growth. Patients with severe primary IGF-1 deficiency (Primary IGFD) fail to produce adequate levels of IGF-1, due to disruption of the growth hormone (GH) pathway used to promote IGF-1 release (possible GH pathway disruptions include mutations in the GH receptor (GHR), post-GHR signaling pathway, and IGF-1 gene defects). Mechanism of action: Mecasermin supplies recombinant-DNA-origin IGF-1, which binds to the Type I IGF-1 receptor. This receptor exerts intra-cellular signaling activity in a number of processes involved in statural growth, including mitogenesis in multiple tissue types, chondrocyte growth and division along cartilage growth plates, and increases in organ growth.
