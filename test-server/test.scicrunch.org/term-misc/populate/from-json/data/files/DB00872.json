It was approved in 2004 for hyponatremia (low blood sodium levels) caused by syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Conivaptan inhibits both isotypes of the vasopressin receptor (V1a and V2). Pharmacology: Conivaptan is a nonpeptide, dual antagonist of arginine vasopressin (AVP) V1A and V2 receptors. The level of AVP in circulating blood is critical for the regulation of water and electrolyte balance and is usually elevated in both euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The AVP effect is mediated through V2 receptors, which are functionally coupled to aquaporin channels in the apical membrane of the collecting ducts of the kidney. These receptors help to maintain plasma osmolality within the normal range. The predominant pharmacodynamic effect of conivaptan in the treatment of hyponatremia is through its V2 antagonism of AVP in the renal collecting ducts, an effect that results in aquaresis, or excretion of free water. The pharmacodynamic effects of conivaptan include increased free water excretion (i.e., effective water clearance (EWC)) generally accompanied by increased net fluid loss, increased urine output, and decreased urine osmolality. Mechanism of action: Conivaptan is a dual AVP antagonist with nanomolar affinity for human V1A and V2 receptors in vitro. This antagonism occurs in the renal collecting ducts, resulting in aquaresis, or excretion of free water. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Aquaresis promoters"}}
