The cell body fiber enters the medial lobe through the gap between the gamma and beta' lobes. Within the gamma lobe, neurite projection is limited to the middle segment between the tip and the base of the lobe, named as gamma4. In the beta', neurites arborize in the lateral part of the beta'a stratum (beta'a1) and the medial segment of beta'm and beta'p strata (beta'm2 and beta'p2). At the medial edge of the beta'm and beta'p strata, some of the fibers project to the contralateral lobe."}}
