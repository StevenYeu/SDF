Members of this group project to various parts of the mushroom body: the tip of the alpha lobe, the tip of the alpha' lobe, the upper portion of the alpha lobe segment 2, alpha lobe segment 1 and the lower part of segment 2, and the pedunculus and spur. Other members of this group arborize in areas other than the mushroom body: the edge of the medial portions of the medial lobes, broad areas surrounding the ipsilateral vertical lobes, areas posterior to the ipsilateral vertical lobes, and the entire span of the superior arch.","hasDBXref":"VFB:FBbt_00100219"}}
