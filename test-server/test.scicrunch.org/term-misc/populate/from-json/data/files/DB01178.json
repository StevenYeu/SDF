It has been suggested for use in the treatment of muscle spasm. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Chlormezanone is a non-benzodiazepine muscle relaxant. It was discontinued worldwide in 1996 by its manufacturer due to confirmed serious and rare cutaneous reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis). Mechanism of action: Chlormezanone binds to central benzodiazepine receptors which interact allosterically with GABA receptors. This potentiates the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, increasing the inhibition of the ascending reticular activating system and blocking the cortical and limbic arousal that occurs following stimulation of the reticular pathways. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Withdrawn. Drug category: Anti-anxiety Agents. Antipsychotics. Benzodiazepines. Muscle Relaxants, Central"}}
