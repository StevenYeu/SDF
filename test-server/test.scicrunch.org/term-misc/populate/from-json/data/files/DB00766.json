The acid is a suicide inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamase enzymes from Streptomyces clavuligerus. Administered alone, it has only weak antibacterial activity against most organisms, but given in combination with beta-lactam antibiotics prevents antibiotic inactivation by microbial lactamase. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Clavulanic acid, produced by the fermentation of Streptomyces Clavuligerus, is a beta-lactam structurally related to the penicillins. Clavulanic acid is used in conjunction with amoxicillin for the treatment of bronchitis and urinary tract, skin, and soft tissue infections caused by beta-lactamase producing organisms. Mechanism of action: Clavulanic acid competitively and irreversibly inhibits a wide variety of beta-lactamases, commonly found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. By inactivating beta-lactamase (the bacterial resistance protein), the accompanying penicillin\/cephalosporin drugs may be made more potent. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents. Enzyme Inhibitors"}}
