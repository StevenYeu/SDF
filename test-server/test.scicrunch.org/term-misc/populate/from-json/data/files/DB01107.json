This medicine was used for treating insomnia, but is now rarely used as it has been replaced by newer drugs with less side effects, such as benzodiazepines. Methyprylon was withdrawn from the US market in June 1965 and the Canadian market in September 1990. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Methyprylon, a piperidinedione CNS depressant, is close to barbituric acid in structure, but different enough to be called a \"non-barbiturate\" sedative-hynotic. Methyprylon is used for insomnia and daytime tension. Methyprylon depresses the activity of muscle tissues, the heart, and the respiratory system. Mechanism of action: Methyprylon binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged. Drug type: Approved. Illicit. Small Molecule. Withdrawn. Drug category: Sedatives and Hypnotics"}}
