The first adequate description of the hypothalamus as a layer of gray matter surrounding the lower half of the third ventricle (Galen, c173) was provided by Wharton (1656, see 1966 translation, p. 170). His (1893, pp. 159-162) introduced the term but assigned the preoptic region (Swanson, 1976, pp. 229-235) of the hypothalamus to the telencephalon (His, 1893b). The definition here was introduced for vertebrates by Kuhlenbeck (1927, p. 67, Ch. 9)."}}
