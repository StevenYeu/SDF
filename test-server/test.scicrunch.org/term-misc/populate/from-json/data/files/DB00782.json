At high doses it has nicotinic effects resulting in neuromuscular blocking. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Propantheline is an anticholinergic drug, a medication that reduces the effect of acetylcholine, a chemical released from nerves that stimulates muscles, by blocking the receptors for acetylcholine on smooth muscle (a type of muscle). It also has a direct relaxing effect on smooth muscle. Propantheline is used to treat or prevent spasm in the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract in the irritable bowel syndrome. In addition, Propantheline inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion and controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions. Mechanism of action: Action is achieved via a dual mechanism: (1) a specific anticholinergic effect (antimuscarinic) at the acetylcholine-receptor sites and (2) a direct effect upon smooth muscle (musculotropic). Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Ulcer Agents. Antimuscarinics. Antispasmodics. Muscarinic Antagonists"}}
