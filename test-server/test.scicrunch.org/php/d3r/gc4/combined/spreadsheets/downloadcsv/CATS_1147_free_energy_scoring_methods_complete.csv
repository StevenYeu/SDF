(gaff2)  4) look for a mapping file specifying the matching atoms in the maximum     common substructure of the ligand pair. if the file is not present,     then the mapping is generated by biosimspace. preliminary simulations     found low atom counts for certain biosimspace generated mappings so,     where necessary, mapping files were generated using additional tools     (fesetup and rdkit). however, it should be noted that all tools struggled     with certain mappings, with each performing better or worse for     different pairs.  5) the first ligand is aligned to the second based on the mapping.  6) the two ligands are merged based on the mapping. this creates a     perturbable molecule describing the two lambda end states (0 and 1)     as well as the properties, e.g. bonds, angles, dihedrals, etc., that     are perturbed.  7) a molecular system is created from the merged molecule, the protein,     and the crystal waters.  8) this system is then solvated in a 60 angstrom cubed box of tip3p     water. existing crystal waters are automatically converted to the     correct water topology and the system is neutralised.  9) a free energy protocol is created using a run time of 4 nanoseconds     per window and 17 linearly spaced windows per free energy leg.  10) using the solvated protein-ligand complex and protocol, biosimspace      automatically configures all of the input required for the full      binding free energy calculation.  11) the simulation is run. for simplicity, each lambda window is run in      sequence. biosimspace can automatically detect crashes and re-run      specific windows as necessary.    the full set of simulations were run on a 10 node gpu cluster with 2  gpus per node. this ran on the oracle cloud infrastructure and was set up  using the following guide  https//cluster-in-the-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#slurm-jobs  a single job submission involved running the full forward  and reverse mappings on the two gpus within a node. a slurm template and  the bash script used for submission can be found at the following links  https//github.com/michellab/d3r2018/blob/master/cats/bss/template.slm  https//github.com/michellab/d3r2018/blob/master/cats/bss/submit.sh    the output the simulations was analysed using the 'analyse_freenrg'  package within sire, which uses the pymbar package to perform multi  state bennet's acceptance ratio analysis. the following bash script  was used to perform incremental analysis as jobs finished  https//github.com/michellab/d3r2018/blob/master/cats/bss/analyse_data.sh",no, No ,free_energy
