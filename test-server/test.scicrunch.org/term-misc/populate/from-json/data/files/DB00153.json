It differs from cholecalciferol in having a double bond between C22 and C23 and a methyl group at C24. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Used in the treatment of hypcalcemia and in dialysis-dependent renal failure. Ergoalcifediol (Vitamin D2) is a fat soluble steroid hormone precursor of vitamin D that contributes to the maintenance of normal levels of calcium and phosphorus in the bloodstream. Mechanism of action: Vitamin D2 is the form of vitamin D most commonly added to foods and nutritional supplements. Vitamin D2 must be transformed (hydroxylated) into one of two active forms via the liver or kidney. Once transformed, it binds to the vitamin D receptor that then leads to a variety of regulatory roles. Vitamin D plays an important role in maintaining calcium balance and in the regulation of parathyroid hormone (PTH). It promotes renal reabsorption of calcium, increases intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and increases calcium and phosphorus mobilization from bone to plasma. Vitamin D2 and its analogs appear to promote intestinal absorption of calcium through binding to a specific receptor in the mucosal cytoplasm of the intestine. Subsequently, calcium is absorbed through formation of a calcium-binding protein. Drug type: Approved. Nutraceutical. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antihypocalcemic Agents.
