It is produced by Streptomyces capreolus. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Capreomycin is a member of the aminoglycoside family of antibiotics. These antibiotics have the ability to kill a wide variety of bacteria, including bacteria responsible for causing tuberculosis (TB). Mechanism of action: Little is known about capreomycin's exact mechanism of action, but it is thought to inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 70S ribosomal unit. Capreomycin also binds to components in the bacterial cell which result in the production of abnormal proteins. These proteins are necessary for the bacteria's survival. Therefore the production of these abnormal proteins is ultimately fatal to the bacteria. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents. Antibiotics, Antitubercular"}}
