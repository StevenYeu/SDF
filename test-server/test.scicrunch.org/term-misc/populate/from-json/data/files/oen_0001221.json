{"Tuning curve":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Electrophysiology concept","Id":"oen_0001221","Definition":"An input output function used in the sensory systems where the average firing rate of the neuron as a function of relevant stimulus parameters is plotted.  For example, the tuning of a neuron is 2000 Hz if the neuron fires at a maximum frequency to the 2000 Hz tone presentation, while firing less to a 1800 Hz or 2200 Hz tone.  Similarly, a somatosensory neuron is tuned to the left index finger if it fires more intensely to touch of the left index finger, than other fingers."}}
