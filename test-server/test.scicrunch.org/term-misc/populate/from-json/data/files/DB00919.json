It is active against gram-negative bacteria and used for the treatment of gonorrhea. Pharmacology: Spectinomycin is an aminocyclitol antibiotic produced by a species of soil microorganism designated as Streptomyces spectabilis. In vitro studies have shown spectinomycin to be active against most strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (minimum inhibitory concentration <7.5 to 20 mcg\/mL). Footprint studies indicate that spectinomycin exerts regional effects on ribosomal structure. Mechanism of action: Spectinomycin is an inhibitor of protein synthesis in the bacterial cell; the site of action is the 30S ribosomal subunit. It is bacteriostatic in its action. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Aminoglycosides. Anti-Bacterial Agents"}}
