Contains 3 enzymes, amylase, lipase and a protease (chymotrypsin). Pharmacology: Used in the treatment of cystic fibrosis or pancreatic dysfunction, pancrelipase helps improve fat digestion in the small intestine. Specifically, the lipase, protease and amylase components break down fat, protein, and starches, respectively, in the small intestine. Lipase hydrolyzes fats into glycerol and fatty acids. Protease converts proteins into proteoses and derived substances, while amylase converts starches into dextrins and sugars. Pancreatic enzymes are used to correct maldigestion, malabsorption and pain associated with pancreatic insufficiency. The major maldigestion\/malabsorption problems arise from incomplete fat digestion. Exogenous pancrelipase reduces the amount of nitrogen and fat excreted in the stool. Mechanism of action: The lipase, protease and amylase components of pancrelipase break down fat, protein, and starches, respectively, in the small intestine. Lipase hydrolyzes fats into glycerol and fatty acids. Protease converts proteins into proteoses and derived substances, while amylase converts starches into dextrins and sugars. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Enzyme Replacement Agents"}}
