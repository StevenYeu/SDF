It forms iron complexes and is used as a chelating agent, particularly in the mesylate form. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Deferoxamine, otherwise known as desferrioxamine or desferal, is a chelating agent used to remove excess iron or aluminum from the body. It acts by binding free iron or aluminum in the bloodstream and enhancing its elimination in the urine. By removing excess iron or aluminum, the agent reduces the damage done to various organs and tissues, such as the liver. Mechanism of action: Deferoxamine works in treating iron toxicity by binding trivalent (ferric) iron (for which it has a strong affinity), forming ferrioxamine, a stable complex which is eliminated via the kidneys. 100 mg of deferoxamine is capable of binding approximately 8.5 mg of trivalent (ferric) iron. Deferoxamine works in treating aluminum toxicity by binding to tissue-bound aluminum to form aluminoxamine, a stable, water-soluble complex. The formation of aluminoxamine increases blood concentrations of aluminum, resulting in an increased concentration gradient between the blood and dialysate, boosting the removal of aluminum during dialysis. 100 mg of deferoxamine is capable of binding approximately 4.1 mg of aluminum.
