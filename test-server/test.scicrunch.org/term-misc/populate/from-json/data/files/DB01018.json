The drug lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by activating the central nervous system alpha-2 adrenoreceptors, which results in reduced sympathetic outflow leading to reduced vascular tone. Its adverse reactions include dry mouth, sedation, and constipation. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Similar to clonidine, guanfacine is a centrally-acting, alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor agonist used alone or in combination with other drugs for the treatment of hypertension. Mechanism of action: Guanfacine selectively stimulates central alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors, resulting in inhibition of sympathetic nervous system outflow, reduction of peripheral and renal vascular resistance, and lowering of blood pressure and heart rate. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Adrenergic alpha-Agonists. Antihypertensive Agents. Sympatholytics"}}
