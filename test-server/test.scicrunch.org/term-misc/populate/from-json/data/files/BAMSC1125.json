The first lies in the deep margin of the zone of vertical cells where it looks very similar to the piriform cells relative to the zone of horizontal cells. Cajal called these the ovoid or triangular cells. The second population has its cell bodies distributed primarily to the upper portion of the zone of optic fibers. Cajal called these triangular or stellate cells. Cajal's nomenclature is rather bulky and, though descriptive, somewhat confusing because stellate cells are a distinct cell type in the nomenclature of this paper and triangular occurs in both names. For reasons developed below, the ovoid or triangular cells or wide field cells of the zone of vertical cells will be called Type II ganglion cells and the triangular or stellate cells or wide field cells of the zone of optic fibers will be called Type III ganglion cells. Type I ganglion cells are the piriform cells. Collator note: we assumed this class of neurons as projection neurons, because at least several subpopulations project to visually related areas.
