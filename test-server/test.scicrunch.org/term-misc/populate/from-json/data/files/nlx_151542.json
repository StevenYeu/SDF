{"Substantia Nigra of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["SN p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151542","Is part of":"Developmentally Diverse Structures of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"The quenelle-shaped substantia nigra is relatively easy to segment on coronal T2-weighted or diffusion-weighted MRI. Ironically, the substantia nigra appears bright on both T2 and DWI contrast. The entire ventral and lateral border is defined by the much darker internal capsule\/cerebral peduncle, which forms a crescent around the substantia nigra. The dorsal and medial border is relatively easy to distinguish from the slightly darker appearing midbrain. Caudally, a line running along the ventrolateral border of the dark medial lemniscus roughly approximates this border."}}
