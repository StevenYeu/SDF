(From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p557) Pharmacology: Trifluridine is a fluorinated pyrimidine nucleoside with in vitro and in vivo activity against herpes simplex virus, types 1 and 2 and vacciniavirus. Some strains of adenovirus are also inhibited in vitro. Trifluridine is also effective in the treatment of epithelial keratitis that has not responded clinically to the topical administration of idoxuridine or when ocular toxicity or hypersensitivity to idoxuridine has occurred. In a smaller number of patients found to be resistant to topical vidarabine, trifluridine was also effective. Trifluridine interferes with DNA synthesis in cultured mammalian cells. However, its antiviral mechanism of action is not completely known. Mechanism of action: Trifluridine interferes with DNA synthesis in cultured mammalian cells. Trifluridine presumably stops replication of herpes viral DNA in 3 ways: 1) competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase, 2) incorporation into and termination of the growing viral DNA chain, and 3) inactivation of the viral DNA polymerase. Trifluridine targets HSV and VSV thymidine kinase. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antimetabolites. Antiviral Agents"}}
