{"Remikiren":{"RelatedTo":"Renin","Synonym":["Ro 42-5892"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB00212","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB00212","Definition":"Remikiren is a renin inhibitor. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Remikiren is an orally available renin inhibitor with an established blood pressure-lowering effect in patients with essential hypertension. No data are available on the renal effects of remikiren in humans. In patients with essential hypertension, a single oral dose of remikiren can induce a renal vasodilation, without affecting the GFR and despite a significant decrease in blood pressure. This systemic and renal hemodynamic response is more pronounced in case of a more activated renin-angiotensin system. Mechanism of action: Several in vivo experiments have shown that remikiren is specific for renin and does not decrease arterial pressure by an unrelated mechanism. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antihypertensive Agents. Protease Inhibitors"}}
