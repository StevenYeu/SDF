It is used as an adjunct in the symptomatic treatment of musculoskeletal conditions associated with painful muscle spasm. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1202) Pharmacology: Carisoprodol is used as a skeletal muscle relaxant. One of its metabolites, meprobamate, is available as an anxiolytic agent. Mechanism of action: The mechanism of action is not known. Rather than acting directly on skeletal muscle, carisoprodol interrupts neuronal communication within the reticular formation and spinal cord, resulting in sedation and alteration in pain perception. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Muscle Relaxants. Muscle Relaxants, Central. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants"}}
