(PubChem) Pharmacology: Tropicamide belongs to the group of medicines called anti-muscarinics. Tropicamide blocks the receptors in the muscles of the eye (muscarinic receptors). These receptors are involved controlling the pupil size and the shape of the lens. By blocking these receptors, tropicamide produces dilatation of the pupil (mydriasis) and prevents the eye from accommodating for near vision (cycloplegia). Tropicamide is given as eye drops to dilate the pupil and relax the lens so that eye examinations can be carried out thoroughly. Mechanism of action: Tropicamide binds to and blocks the receptors in the muscles of the eye (muscarinic receptor M4). Tropicamide acts by blocking the responses of the iris sphincter muscle to the iris and ciliary muscles to cholinergic stimulation, producing dilation of the pupil and paralysis of the ciliary muscle. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Diagnostic aid, cycloplegic. Diagnostic aid, mydriatic. Muscarinic Antagonists. Mydriatics"}}
