It is also used at low doses for the management of hypertension. It is marketed under the brand name Demadex. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Torasemide (INN) or torsemide (USAN) is a novel loop diuretic belonging to pridine sulphonyl urea. It differs form other thiazide diuretics in that a double ring system is incorporated into its structure. Like thiazides, loop diuretics must be secreted into the tubular fluid by proximal tubule cells. In the thick ascending loop Na+ and Cl- reabsorption is accomplished by a Na+\/K+\/2Cl- symporter. The thick ascending limb has a high reabsorptive capacity and is responsible for reabsorbing 25% of the filtered load of Na+. The loop diuretics act by blocking this symporter. Because of the large absorptive capacity and the amount of Na+ delivered to the ascending limb, loop diuretics have a profound diuretic action. In addition, more distal nephron segments do not have the reabsorptive capacity to compensate for this increased load. The osmotic gradient for water reabsorption is also reduced resulting in an increase in the amount of water excreted. Mechanism of action: Torasemide inhibits the Na+\/K+\/2Cl--carrier system (via interference of the chloride binding site) in the lumen of the thick ascending portion of the loop of Henle, resulting in a decrease in reabsorption of sodium and chloride. This results in an increase in the rate of delivery of tubular fluid and electrolytes to the distal sites of hydrogen and potassium ion secretion, while plasma volume contraction increases aldosterone production. The increased delivery and high aldosterone levels promote sodium reabsorption at the distal tubules, and By increasing the delivery of sodium to the distal renal tubule, torasemide indirectly increases potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. Torasemide's effects in other segments of the nephron have not been demonstrated. Thus torasemide increases the urinary excretion of sodium, chloride, and water, but it does not significantly alter glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, or acid-base balance. Torasemide's effects as a antihypertensive are due to its diuretic actions. By reducing extracellular and plasma fluid volume, blood pressure is reduced temporarily, and cardiac output also decreases. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule.
