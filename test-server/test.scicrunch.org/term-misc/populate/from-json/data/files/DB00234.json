Its mesylate (i.e. methanesulfonate) salt is sold under tradenames including Edronax, Norebox, Prolift, Solvex, Davedax or Vestra. Reboxetine has two chiral centers, but it only exists as two enantiomers, (R,R)-(-)- and (S,S)-(+)-reboxetine. Pharmacology: Reboxetine is a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (NaRI), the firstdrug of new antidepressant class. Reboxetine is an a-ariloxybenzyl derivative ofmorpholine. Reboxetine is primarily used to treat depression but has also beenfound useful in the treatment of narcolepsy and panic disorders. Mechanism of action: Reboxetine is a selective inhibitor of noradrenaline reuptake. It inhibitsnoradrenaline reuptake in vitro to a similar extent to the tricyclicantidepressant desmethylimipramine. Reboxetine does not affect dopamine orserotonin reuptake and it has low in vivo and in vitro affinityfor adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, dopaminergic and serotonergicreceptors. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors. Antidepressive Agents"}}
