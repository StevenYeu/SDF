It is used to treat asthma; HAY fever; urticaria; and rhinitis; and also in veterinary applications. Tripelennamine is administered by various routes, including topically. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Used to treat the effects of colds and allergies. Tripelennamine is an antihistamine. Histamine, acting on H1-receptors, produces pruritis, vasodilatation, hypotension, flushing, headache, tachycardia, and bronchoconstriction. Histamine also increases vascular permeability and potentiates pain. Tripelennamine is a histamine H1 antagonist. It competes with histamine for the normal H1-receptor sites on effector cells of the gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels and respiratory tract. It provides effective, temporary relief of sneezing, watery and itchy eyes, and runny nose due to hay fever and other upper respiratory allergies. Mechanism of action: Tripelennamine binds to the histamine H1 receptor. This blocks the action of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Allergic Agents. Ethylenediamine Derivatives. Histamine H1 Antagonists"}}
