The enzyme is responsible for converting adenosine to inosine. In the absence of adenosine deaminase, the purine substrates adenosine, 2'-deoxyadenosine and their metabolites are actually toxic to lymphocytes thereby leading to diminished immune function. Mechanism of action: Pegademase converts adenosine (toxic) to inosine (less toxic) by deamination. It also converts 2'-deoxyadenosine to 2'-deoxyinosine via deamination. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Enzyme Replacement Agents"}}
