The cell body fiber projects towards the anterior of the inferior neuropils. On the way there it bifurcates with one branch turning ventrally and terminating in the ventral complex. The second branch further branches in the inferior neuropil close to the beta lobe. One of these branches runs medially to the opposite hemisphere. Another turns ventrolaterally and arborizes in the basal segments of the gamma lobe and the alpha lobe. The final branch arborizes in the anterior region of the inferior neuropil.","hasDBXref":"FlyBrain_NDB:10466"}}
