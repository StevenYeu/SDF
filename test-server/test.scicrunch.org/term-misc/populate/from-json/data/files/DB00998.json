The product is licensed to Endo Pharmaceuticals in North America and Menarini in Europe.(1) Frovatriptan causes vasoconstriction of arteries and veins that supply blood to the head. It is available as 2.5 mg tablets.Frovatriptan has mean terminal elimination half-life of approximately 26 hours, which is substantially longer than other triptans.Frovatriptan is available only by prescription in the United States, where a secondary New Drug Approval (sNDA) was filed in July 2006(2) and which is currently pending.(3) The FDA anticipates completing its review of this application on or before the current PDUFA (Prescription Drug User Fee Act) review date of August 19, 2007. If the sNDA is approved, Frova will be the only medication indicated in the U.S. for the short-term prevention of menstrual migraine (MM). Pharmacology: Frovatriptan is a second generation triptan 5-HT receptor agonist that binds with high affinity for 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors. Frovatriptan has no significant effects on GABAA mediated channel activity and has no significant affinity for benzodiazepine binding sites. Frovatriptan is believed to act on extracerebral, intracranial arteries and to inhibit excessive dilation of these vessels in migraine. Research has shown that migraine can be caused by the swelling of blood vessels around the brain. Frovatriptan eases the pain associated with migraine by narrowing these blood vessels. Frovatriptan has one of the highest affinities for the 5-HT1B of the second-generation triptan agonists. Mechanism of action: Three distinct pharmacological actions have been implicated in the antimigraine effect of the triptans: (1) stimulation of presynaptic 5-HT1D receptors, which serves to inhibit both dural vasodilation and inflammation; (2) direct inhibition of trigeminal nuclei cell excitability via 5-HT1B\/1D receptor agonism in the brainstem and (3) vasoconstriction of meningeal, dural, cerebral or pial vessels as a result of vascular 5-HT1B receptor agonism. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-inflammatory Agents. Anti-migraine Agents. Serotonin Agonists. Vasoconstrictor Agents"}}
