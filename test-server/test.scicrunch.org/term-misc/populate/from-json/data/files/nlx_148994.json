It projects its axons in three different regions: where the dendritic tree is located and in the dorsolateral and inferior dorsofrontal protocerebrum domains. It establishes synaptic contacts with the pioneer mushroom body alpha \/ beta neurons in a small dorsal frontal domain of the mushroom body calyx (Chen et al., 2012). There are two pairs of DAL neurons per hemisphere (Xia et al., 2005)."}}
