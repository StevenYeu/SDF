{"Midbrain of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["midbrain p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151521","Definition":"The midbrain can be readily segmented on coronal T2-weighted MRI. Rostrally the border with the diencephalon is complex. Moving caudally, the midbrain begins to emerge ventral to the diencephalon just as the substantia nigra (light on T2) comes in to view. The emerging oculomotor nerve\u2013a dark streak on T2\u2013is one of the best markers of the ventral midbrain. Further caudally, at roughly the caudal-most extent of the mammillary bodies, the slightly brighter superior colliculus emerges at the dorsal border of the diencephalon. Still further caudal the dorsal and ventral parts of the midbrain move closer together as the diencephalon disappears. Finally, near the caudal border of the substantia nigra all that remains of the diencephalon is a light appearing protrusion from the midbrain medially in to the hippocampus laterally (the geniculate nuclei). The dorsal border between the midbrain and hippocampus\/retrosplenial cortex is clearly defined by a small thin potential space that can appear as a light or dark line depending on the presence or absence of water in the space. The ventral border with hindbrain is comparably simple. Moving caudally through the pontine nuclei the border between the midbrain and hindbrain moves dorsally as a horizontal line between the ventral-most extents of the inferior colliculi, or just above the very dark medial longitudinal fasciculus. Even further caudally this border sits just ventral to the fourth ventricle. The caudal border between the midbrain and cerebellar cortex is straightforward, as the superior colliculi appear significantly darker than the cortex of the 2nd-4th cerebellar lobules."}}
