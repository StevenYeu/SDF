It is used for insomnia, particularly delayed sleep onset. Ramelteon has not been shown to produce dependence and has shown no potential for abuse. Pharmacology: Ramelton is the first selective melatonin agonist. It works by mimicing melatonin (MT), a naturally occuring hormone that is produced during the sleep period. It has a high affinity for the MT1 and MT2 receptor. The MT1 and MT2 receptors are located in the brain's suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). The SCN is known as the body's \"master clock\" because it regulates the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle. Ramelton has an active metabolite that is less potent but circulates in higher concentrations than the parent compound. The metabolite also has weak affinity for the 5HT2b receptor. Mechanism of action: Ramelton is a melatonin receptor agonist with both high affinity for melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors and selectivity over the MT3 receptor. Ramelteon demonstrates full agonist activity in vitro in cells expressing human MT1 or MT2 receptors, and high selectivity for human MT 1 and MT2 receptors compared to the MT3 receptor. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Hypnotics and Sedatives"}}
