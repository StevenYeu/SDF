Scharfman"],"Definition":"\"The Dentate gyrus HIPP cell (HIlar Perforant Path-associated cell) is an interneuron in the Hippocampal formation. It is a long-spined multipolar cell that is conspicuous of distribution of copious, long and often branched spines over its cell body and dendrites. The axonal plexus can extend as much as 3.5mm along the septotemporal axis of the dentate gyrus. Since inhibitory interneurons typically have aspiny dendrites and relatively local axonal plexuses, this long spined multipolar\/HIPP cell is a very atypical interneuron\"."}}
