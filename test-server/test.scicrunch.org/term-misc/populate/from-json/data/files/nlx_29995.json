{"Delta wave":{"RelatedTo":"Sleep pattern","Synonym":["Delta oscillation","Delta","Delta Rhythm"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Oscillation","Id":"nlx_29995","Definition":"is a high amplitude brain wave with a frequency of 1\u20134 hertz which can be recorded with an electroencephalogram (EEG) and is usually associated with slow-wave sleep.  Delta wave activity occurs most frequently during stage N3 slow-wave sleep, accounting for 20% or more of the EEG record during this stage. These waves are believed to originate in the thalamus in coordination with the reticular formation (adapted from Wikipedia)."}}
