It inhibits DNA metabolism and is used as an antineoplastic, especially for solid tumors. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Bleomycin is an antibiotic which has been shown to have antitumor activity. Bleomycin selectively inhibits the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The guanine and cytosine content correlates with the degree of mitomycin-induced cross-linking. At high concentrations of the drug, cellular RNA and protein synthesis are also suppressed. Bleomycin has been shown in vitro to inhibit B cell, T cell, and macrophage proliferation and impair antigen presentation, as well as the secretion of interferon gamma, TNFa, and IL-2. The antibiotic antitumor drugs are cell cycle-nonspecific except for Bleomycin (which has major effects in G2 and M phases). Mechanism of action: Although the exact mechanism of action of bleomycin is unknown, available evidence would seem to indicate that the main mode of action is the inhibition of DNA synthesis with some evidence of lesser inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antibiotics, Antineoplastic. Antimetabolites"}}
