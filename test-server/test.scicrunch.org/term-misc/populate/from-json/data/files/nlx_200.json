It is an X-linked recessive disease, primarily affecting males who inherit a genetic mutation from their mothers. Boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy lack the protein dystrophin, which is essential for keeping muscle cells intact. Duchenne muscular dystrophy usually becomes evident when a child begins walking. Patients typically require a wheelchair by age 10 to 12 and die in their late teens or early twenties."}}
