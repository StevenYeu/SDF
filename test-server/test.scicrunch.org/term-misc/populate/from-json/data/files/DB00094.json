The - and - subunits have 92 and 111 amino acids Pharmacology: Used for the treatment of female infertility, urofollitropin or follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates ovarian follicular growth in women who do not have primary ovarian failure. FSH, the active component of urofollitropin is the primary hormone responsible for follicular recruitment and development. Mechanism of action: FSH binds to the follicle stimulating hormone receptor which is a G-coupled transmembrane receptor. Binding of the FSH to its receptor seems to induce phosphorylation and activation of the PI3K (Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase) and Akt signaling pathway, which is known to regulate many other metabolic and related survival\/maturation functions in cells. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Fertility Agents"}}
