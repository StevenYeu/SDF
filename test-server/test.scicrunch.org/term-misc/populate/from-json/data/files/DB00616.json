Pharmacology: Candoxatril is the orally-active prodrug of candoxatrilat (UK-73967), the active enantiomer of candoxatrilat (UK-69578), a potent neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor used in the treatment of chronic heart failure in man. Mechanism of action: Neutral endopeptidase inhibitors such as Candoxatril have a dual mechanism of action. They inhibit two metalloprotease enzymes, neutral endopeptidase and ACE, resulting in an increased availability of natriuretic peptides that exhibit vasodilatory effects and, possibly, tissue protective effects. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antihypertensive Agents. Prodrugs. Protease Inhibitors"}}
