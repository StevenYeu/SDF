It is effective in the treatment of angina pectoris and hypertension. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Amlodipine, a calcium-channel blocker, is used alone or with benazepril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, to treat hypertension, chronic stable angina pectoris, and Prinzmetal's variant angina. Amlodipine is similar to the peripheral vasodilator nifedipine and other members of the dihydropyridine class. Mechanism of action: Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocking agent. It inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes. The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload. Another possible mechanism is that amlodipine inhibits vascular smooth muscle carbonic anhydrase I activity with consecutive pH increase which may be involved in intracelluar calcium influx through calcium channels.
