It also is useful in the treatment of panic disorder and the phobic disorders. (From AMA, Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p311) Pharmacology: Isocarboxazid is a non-selective hydrazine monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor used to treat depression. In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated inhibition of MAO in the brain, heart, and liver. Depression is a complicated disease that is not fully understood. It is thought that depression may be linked to an imbalance of chemicals within the brain. When depression occurs, there may be a decrease in the amount of chemicals released from nerve cells in the brain. These chemicals are called monoamines. Monoamines are broken down by a chemical called monoamine oxidase. Isocarboxazid prevents monoamine oxidase from breaking down the monoamines. This results in an increased amount of active monoamines in the brain. By increasing the amount of monoamines in the brain, the imbalance of chemicals thought to be caused by depression is altered. This helps relieve the symptoms of depression. Mechanism of action: Isocarboxazid works by irreversibly blocking the action of a chemical substance known as monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the nervous system. MAO subtypes A and B are involved in the metabolism of serotonin and catecholamine neurotransmitters such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Isocarboxazid, as a nonselective MAO inhibitor, binds irreversibly to monoamine oxidaseA (MAO-A) and monoamine oxidaseB (MAO-B). The reduced MAO activity results in an increased concentration of these neurotransmitters in storage sites throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and sympathetic nervous system. This increased availability of one or more monoamines is the basis for the antidepressant activity of MAO inhibitors. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antidepressants.
