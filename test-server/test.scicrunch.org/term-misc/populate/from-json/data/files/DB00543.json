It also blocks dopamine receptors. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Amoxapine is a tricyclic antidepressant of the dibenzoxazepine class, chemically distinct from the dibenzodiazepines, dibenzocycloheptenes, and dibenzoxepines. It has a mild sedative component to its action. The mechanism of its clinical action in man is not well understood. In animals, amoxapine reduced the uptake of nor-epinephirine and serotonin and blocked the response of dopamine receptors to dopamine Amoxapine is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Clinical studies have demonstrated that amoxapine has a more rapid onset of action than either amitriptyline or imipramine Mechanism of action: Amoxapine acts by decreasing the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin (5-HT). Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors. Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation. Dopamine Antagonists. Neurotransmitter Uptake Inhibitors. Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors"}}
