It is used in treatment of hay fever, rhinitis, allergic dermatoses, and pruritus. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Pheniramine is an antihistamine used to treat allergic conditions such as hay fever or urticaria. It is generally sold in combination with other medications, rather than as a stand-alone drug. Mechanism of action: Antihistamines such as pheniramine appear to compete with histamine for histamine H1- receptor sites on effector cells. The antihistamines antagonize those pharmacological effects of histamine which are mediated through activation of H1- receptor sites and thereby reduce the intensity of allergic reactions and tissue injury response involving histamine release. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Allergic Agents. Antipruritic Agents. Antipruritics. Histamine H1 Antagonists"}}
