{"Olfactory system":{"RelatedTo":"Olfactory system function","Synonym":["Chemosensation"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Sensory system","Id":"nlx_anat_090806","Definition":"The sensory system used for olfaction, or the sense of smell. Most mammals and reptiles have two distinct parts to their olfactory system: a main olfactory system and an accessory olfactory system. The main olfactory system detects volatile, airborne substances, while the accessory olfactory system senses fluid-phase stimuli. Behavioral evidence indicates that most often, the stimuli detected by the accessory olfactory system are pheromones.The olfactory system is often spoken of along with the gustatory system as the chemosensory senses because both transduce chemical signals into perception. - definition adapted from Wikipedia"}}
