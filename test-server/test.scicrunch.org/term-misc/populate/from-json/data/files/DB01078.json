A cardiotonic glycoside from the leaves of Digitalis lanata. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Deslanoside is a cardiac glycoside used to treat congestive heart failure and supraventricular arrhythmias due to reentry mechanisms, and to control ventricular rate in the treatment of chronic atrial fibrillation. Mechanism of action: Deslanoside inhibits the Na-K-ATPase membrane pump, resulting in an increase in intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations. Increased intracellular concentrations of calcium may promote activation of contractile proteins (e.g., actin, myosin). Deslanoside also acts on the electrical activity of the heart, increasing the slope of phase 4 depolarization, shortening the action potential duration, and decreasing the maximal diastolic potential. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Arrhythmia Agents. Cardiotonic Agents. Enzyme Inhibitors"}}
