His intention was for institution to be home to exceptional individuals\u2013men and women with imagination and extraordinary dedication capable of working at the cutting edge of their fields. Today, Carnegie scientists work in six scientific departments on the West and East Coasts. Carnegie investigators are leaders in the fields of plant biology, developmental biology, Earth and planetary sciences, astronomy, and global ecology. They seek answers to questions about the structure of the universe, the formation of our solar system and other planetary systems, the behavior and transformation of matter when subjected to extreme conditions, the origin of life, the function of genes, and the development of organisms from single-celled egg to adult.The Carnegie Institution for Science is headquartered in Washington, D.C. It is an endowed, independent, nonprofit institution. Significant additional support comes from federal grants and private donations. A board of trustees, consisting of leaders in business, the sciences, education, and public service, oversees Carnegie's operations. Each of the six departments has its own scientific director who manages day-to-day operations under the leadership of Richard A. Meserve, Carnegie president. In addition to the scientists on staff, there is a constantly changing roster of pre- and postdoctoral fellows and associates, as well as visiting investigators, at each facility. Each of the six departments is independently managed by a director, who is aided by support staff. Carnegie is also involved in education at the lower levels."}}
