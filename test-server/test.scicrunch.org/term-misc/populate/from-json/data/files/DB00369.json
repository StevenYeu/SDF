It suppresses CMV replication by selective inhibition of viral DNA synthesis. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Cidofovir is a new anti-viral drug. It is classified as a nucleotide analogue and is active against herpes cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis infection. Most adults are infected with CMV. Cidofovir suppresses cytomegalovirus (CMV) replication by selective inhibition of viral DNA synthesis. Biochemical data support selective inhibition of CMV DNA polymerase by cidofovir diphosphate, the active intracellular metabolite of cidofovir. Cidofovir diphosphate inhibits herpesvirus polymerases at concentrations that are 8- to 600-fold lower than those needed to inhibit human cellular DNA polymerase alpha, beta, and gamma(1,2,3). Incorporation of cidofovir into the growing viral DNA chain results in reductions in the rate of viral DNA synthesis. Mechanism of action: Cidofovir acts through the selective inhibition of viral DNA polymerase. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-HIV Agents. Antineoplastic Agents. Antiviral Agents. Radiation-Sensitizing Agents"}}
