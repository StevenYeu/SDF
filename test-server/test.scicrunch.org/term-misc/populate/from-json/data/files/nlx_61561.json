{"Microelectrode Beveler":{"SuperCategory":"Measurement device","Comment":"Wikipedia","Id":"nlx_61561","Has role":"Instrument role{{PONS brain region","Organism":"50","Definition":"The basic beveling system consists of a stationary pedestal, optically flat to a half wave (250nm), surface mounted on a heavy baseplate. This serves as a bearing for an abrasive coated glass grinding plate, which is also flat to half a wave. The flat abrasive plate is coupled to a low vibration, slow-speed motor by means of magnetic fields to provide a wobble-free flat grinding surface. The abrasive plates are fabricated with a proprietary process which insures a consistent abrasive coating. "}}
