Pharmacology: Butoconazole is an imidazole derivative that has fungicidal activity in vitro against Candida spp. and has been demonstrated to be clinically effective against vaginal infections due to Candida albicans. Candida albicans has been identified as the predominant species responsible for vulvovaginal candidasis. Mechanism of action: The exact mechanism of the antifungal action of butoconazole is unknown, however, it is presumed to function as other imidazole derivatives via inhibition of steroid synthesis. Imidazoles generally inhibit the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol via the inhibition of the enzyme cytochrome P450 14-demethylase, resulting in a change in fungal cell membrane lipid composition. This structural change alters cell permeability and, ultimately, results in the osmotic disruption or growth inhibition of the fungal cell. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antifungal Agents"}}
