{"Pathway":{"Synonym":["network","module","cascade","Examples: glycolysis","valine biosynthesis"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Entity","Id":"Pathway","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.biopax.org\/release\/biopax-level3.owl#Pathway","Definition":"A set or series of interactions, often forming a network, which biologists have found useful to group together for organizational, historic, biophysical or other reasons. Usage: Pathways can be used for demarcating any subnetwork of a BioPAX model. It is also possible to define a pathway without specifying the interactions within the pathway. In this case, the pathway instance could consist simply of a name and could be treated as a 'black box'. Pathways can overlap, i.e. a single interaction might belong to multiple pathways. Pathways can also contain sub-pathways. Taken from BioPAX"}}
