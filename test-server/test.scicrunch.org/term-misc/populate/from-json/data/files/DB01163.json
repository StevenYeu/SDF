{"Amdinocillin":{"RelatedTo":"Penicillin-binding protein 2B","Synonym":["Amdinocillin mecillinam"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB01163","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB01163","Definition":"Amidinopenicillanic acid derivative with broad spectrum antibacterial action. It is poorly absorbed if given orally and is used in urinary infections and typhus. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Amdinocillin is a novel, semisynthetic penicillin effective against many gram-negative bacteria. The antibacterial activity of amdinocillin is derived from its ability to bind specifically and avidly to Penicillin Binding Protein-2 (PBP 2). Amdinocillin is active alone against many gram-negative organisms. Pseudomonas and non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria, however, are usually resistant. Amdinocillin, in combination with many beta-lactams, exhibits marked synergy against many enterobacteriaceae. No such synergy can be demonstrated for gram-positive organisms or pseudomonas species. Amdinocillin is not beta-lactamase stable. Organisms which produce high levels of plasma-mediated beta-lactamase are resistant to the drug. Co-administration of probenecid results in markedly elevated plasma levels of amdinocillin and delays its excretion. Mechanism of action: Amdinocillin is a stong and specific antagonist of Penicillin Binding Protein-2 (PBP 2). Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents. Anti-Infective Agents, Urinary. Penicillins"}}
