It was for some years in the mid-1990s approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the purposes of weight loss. However, following multiple concerns about the cardiovascular side-effects of the drug, such approval was withdrawn. Pharmacology: Used to treat diabetes and obesity, Dexfenfluramine decreases caloric intake by increasing serotonin levels in the brains synapses. Dexfenfluramine acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It also causes release of serotonin from the synaptosomes. Mechanism of action: Dexfenfluramine binds to the serotonin reuptake pump. This causes inhbition of serotonin uptake and release of serotonin. The increased levels of serotonin lead to greater serotonin receptor activation which in turn lead to enhancement of serotoninergic transmission in the centres of feeding behavior located in the hypothalamus. This suppresses the appetite for carbohydrates. Drug type: Approved. Illicit. Small Molecule. Withdrawn. Drug category: Antiobesity Agents. Appetite Depressants. Serotonin Agonists. Serotonin reuptake inhibitor"}}
