Ophthalmic NSAIDs are becoming a cornerstone for the management of ocular pain and inflammation. Their well-characterized anti-inflammatory activity, analgesic property, and established safety record have also made NSAIDs an important tool to optimize surgical outcomes. Pharmacology: Bromfenac ophthalmic solution is a sterile, topical, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for ophthalmic use. Mechanism of action: The mechanism of its action is thought to be due to its ability to block prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting cyclooxygenase 1 and 2. Prostaglandins have been shown in many animal models to be mediators of certain kinds of intraocular inflammation. In studies performed in animal eyes, prostaglandins have been shown to produce disruption of the blood-aqueous humor barrier, vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, leukocytosis, and increased intraocular pressure. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Analgesics. Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}}
