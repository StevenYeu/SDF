Pharmacology: Alseroxylon is a purified extract of Rauwolfia serpentina, containing reserpine and other amorphous alkaloids. Alseroxylon is an indole alkaloid antipsychotic and antihypertensive drug known to irreversibly bind to storage vesicles of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. This leads to depletion of the neurotransmitters and subsequent depression in humans. Mechanism of action: The antihypertensive actions of alseroxylon are a result of its ability to deplete catecholamines from peripheral sympathetic nerve endings. Alseroxylon almost irreversibly blocks the accumulation of noradrenaline and dopamine into synaptic vesicles by inhibiting the Vesicular Monoamine Transporters (VMAT). Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors"}}
