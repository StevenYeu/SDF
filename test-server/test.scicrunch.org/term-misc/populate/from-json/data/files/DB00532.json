It may cause blood dyscrasias. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Mephenytoin is an antiepileptic drug which can be useful in the treatment of epilepsy. The primary site of action appears to be the motor cortex where spread of seizure activity is inhibited. Possibly by promoting sodium efflux from neurons, mephenytoin tends to stabilize the threshold against hyperexcitability caused by excessive stimulation or environmental changes capable of reducing membrane sodium gradient. This includes the reduction of posttetanic potentiation at synapses. Loss of posttetanic potentiation prevents cortical seizure foci from detonating adjacent cortical areas. Mephenytoin reduces the maximal activity of brain stem centers responsible for the tonic phase of tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures. Mechanism of action: The mechanism of action of mephenytoin is not definitely known, but extensive research strongly suggests that its main mechanism is to block frequency-, use- and voltage-dependent neuronal sodium channels, and therefore limit repetitive firing of action potentials. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anticonvulsants"}}
