Pharmacology: Used to treat diabetes and obesity, Fenfluramine decreases caloric intake by increasing serotonin levels in the brain's synapses. Fenfluramine acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It also causes release of serotonin from the synaptosomes. Mechanism of action: Fenfluramine binds to the serotonin reuptake pump. This causes inhbition of serotonin uptake and release of serotonin. The increased levels of serotonin lead to greater serotonin receptor activation which in turn lead to enhancement of serotoninergic transmission in the centres of feeding behavior located in the hypothalamus. This suppresses the appetite for carbohydrates. Drug type: Illicit. Small Molecule. Withdrawn. Drug category: Anorexigenic Agents. Serotonin Agonists. Serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Stimulants"}}
