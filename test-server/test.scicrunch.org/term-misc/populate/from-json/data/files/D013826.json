Two types of theta rhythm have been described. The \"hippocampal theta rhythm\" (6\u201310 Hz) is a strong oscillation that can be observed in the hippocampus and other brain structures in numerous species of mammals including rodents, rabbits, dogs, cats, bats, and marsupials. \"Cortical theta rhythms\" (4\u20137 Hz) are low-frequency components of scalp EEG, usually recorded from humans (adapted from Wikipedia)."}}
