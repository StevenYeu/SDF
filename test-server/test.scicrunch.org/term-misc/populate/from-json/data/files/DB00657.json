Mecamylamine has been used as a ganglionic blocker in treating hypertension, but, like most ganglionic blockers, is more often used now as a research tool. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Mecamylamine is a potent, oral antihypertensive agent and ganglion blocker, and is a secondary amine. Mecamylamine is indicated for the management of moderately severe to severe essential hypertension and in uncomplicated cases of malignant hypertension. Mecamylamine reduces blood pressure in both normotensive and hypertensive individuals. A small oral dosage often produces a smooth and predictable reduction of blood pressure. Although this antihypertensive effect is predominantly orthostatic, the supine blood pressure is also significantly reduced. Mecamylamine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers. Mechanism of action: Mecamylamine is a ganglionic blocker which prevents stimulation of postsynaptic receptors by acetylcholine released from presynaptic nerve endings. The hypotensive effect of Mecamylamine is attributed to reduction in sympathetic tone, vasodilation, and reduced cardiac output, and is primarily postural. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antihypertensive Agents. Ganglionic Blockers. Nicotinic Antagonists"}}
