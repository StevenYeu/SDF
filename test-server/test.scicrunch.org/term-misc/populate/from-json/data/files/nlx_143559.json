{"Paleocortex":{"DefiningCriteria":"cyto-architecture","CurationStatus":"uncurated","ChemoDefiningCriteria":"Three to five cytoarchitectural layers","NeuronamesID":"2336","SuperCategory":"Regional part of brain","Id":"nlx_143559","Is part of":"Allocortex","Definition":"Part of the allocortex defined on the basis of cytoarchitecture. The other two are archicortex and periallocortex. It consists of very thin, primitive cortex with few clearly defined layers. It is distinguished ontogenetically by the fact that it does not develop through a cortical plate. It includes the olfactory bulb, accessory olfactory bulb, olfactory tubercle, septum, prepyriform area and periamygdalar area ( Stephan-1975 ). (adapted from Brain Info)"}}
