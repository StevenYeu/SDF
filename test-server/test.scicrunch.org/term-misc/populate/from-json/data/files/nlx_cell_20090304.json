Resembles the mitral cell of the main olfactory bulb, though somewhat smaller and less clearly differentiated.  The cell bodies are arranged in a thin layer between the granule cell layer and the external plexiform layer.  Each mitral cell is characterized by one (occasionally several) primary dendrite that traverses the external plexiform layer and terminates within an olfactory glomerulus in a tuft of branches where it receives input from the axons of sensory cells of the vomeronasal organ."}}
