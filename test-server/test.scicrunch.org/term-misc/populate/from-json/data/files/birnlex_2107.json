{"Staining":{"Created":"2006-06-01","EditorialNote":"BIRNLex should make use of OBO Flybase bioimaging (FBbi ontology) (see the EBI Ontology Browser), once it is available in OWL.  Though we could use the OBO to OWL converts, this is problematic.","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Specimen preparation","Id":"birnlex_2107","Definition":"Used in various techniques, staining is the artificial coloration of a substance that enhances the contrast of tissues, genes, cells, or microorganisms(etc.), to be viewed under the microscope. In biochemistry it involves adding a class-specific (DNA, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates) dye to a substrate to qualify or quantify the presence of a specific compound. Staining can serve the same purpose as fluorescent tagging. (Adapted from Wikipedia)"}}
