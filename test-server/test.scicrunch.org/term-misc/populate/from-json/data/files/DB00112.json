Bevacizumab contains human framework regions and the complementarity-determining regions of a murine antibody that binds to VEGF. Bevacizumab is produced in a Chinese Hamster Ovary mammalian cell expression system in a nutrient medium containing the antibiotic gentamicin and has a molecular weight of approximately 149 kilodaltons. Pharmacology: Bevacizumab prevents or reduces the formation of blood vessels (angiogenesis) thereby preventing or reducing metatstatic disease progressing. Bevacizumab binds VEGF and prevents vascular endothelial growth and endothelial cell proliferation. Mechanism of action: Bevacizumab binds VEGF and prevents the interaction of VEGF to its receptors (Flt-1 and KDR) on the surface of endothelial cells. This prevents blood vessel growth. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Antiangiogenesis Agents. Antineoplastic Agents"}}
