Its axonal projection bifurcates, with one of the main branches projecting to the contralateral side and exiting the brain and bifurcating again. One of these secondary branches fasciculates with the nerve tracts that innervate the corpus cardiacum in the ring gland and also innervate the hypocerebral ganglion. The other follows the aorta and innervates the heart (Cao and Brown, 2001, Rulifson et al., 2002, Ikeya et al., 2002). The other main projection innervates the subesophageal ganglion and the esophagus (Rulifson et al., Ikeya et al., 2002). These cells are present in a bilateral cell body cluster of four to five cells in each hemisphere (Cao and Brown, 2001, Rulifson et al., 2002, Ikeya et al., 2002)."}}
