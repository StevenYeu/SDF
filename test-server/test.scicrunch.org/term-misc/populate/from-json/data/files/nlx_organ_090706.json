Loss of function in parkin results in the accumulation of toxic substrates. This causes locomotive defects, dopaminergic neuron degeneration, mitochondrial dysfunction, and sensitivity to oxidative stress.  Physically, Parkin mutants are smaller, show locomotive dysfunction, sterile, and have a decreased lifespan.  Parkin mutant drosophila exhibit many of the same symptoms as Parkinson's disease and are used in the laboratory to study the disease."}}
