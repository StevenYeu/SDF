It inhibits uptake of catecholamines and blocks the binding of cocaine to the dopamine uptake transporter. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Mazindol is a sympathomimetic amine, which is similar to an amphetamine. Mazindol stimulates the central nervous system (nerves and brain), which increases your heart rate and blood pressure and decreases your appetite. Sympathomimetic appetite suppressants are used in the short-term treatment of obesity. Their appetite-reducing effect tends to decrease after a few weeks. Because of this, these medicines are useful only during the first few weeks of a weight-loss program. Mechanism of action: Although the mechanism of action of the sympathomimetics in the treatment of obesity is not fully known, these medications have pharmacological effects similar to those of amphetamines. Unlike other sympathomimetic appetite suppressants such as phentermine, mazindol is thought to inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine rather than to cause its release. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors. Central Nervous System Stimulants. Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors"}}
