It is manufactured by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. under the trade name Pletal. Although drugs similar to cilostazol have increased the risk of death in patients with congestive heart failure, studies of significant size have not addressed people without the disease. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Cilostazol is a quinolinone derivative indicated for the reduction of symptoms of intermittent claudication, as indicated by an increased walking distance. Intermittent claudication is pain in the legs that occurs with walking and disappears with rest. The pain occurs due to reduced blood flow to the legs. Mechanism of action: The mechanism of the effects of cilostazol on the symptoms of intermittent claudication is not fully understood. Cilostazol and several of its metabolites are cyclic AMP (cAMP) phosphodiesterase III inhibitors (PDE III inhibitors), inhibiting phosphodiesterase activity and suppressing cAMP degradation with a resultant increase in cAMP in platelets and blood vessels, leading to inhibition of platelet aggregation and vasodilation. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Bronchodilator Agents. Fibrinolytic Agents. Neuroprotective Agents. Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors. Vasodilator Agents"}}
