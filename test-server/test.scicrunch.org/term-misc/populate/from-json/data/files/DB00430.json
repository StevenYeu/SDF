Pharmacology: Cefpiramide is a cephalosporin active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. Cefpiramide works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. The plasma half-lives of cefpiramide in rabbits, dogs, and rhesus monkeys were much longer than those of cefoperazone and cefazolin. Mechanism of action: The bactericidal activity of cefpiramide results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents. Cephalosporins"}}
