Pharmacology: Used in the treatment of anemia. Involved in the regulation of erythrocyte differentiation and the maintenance of a physiological level of circulating erythrocyte mass. Mechanism of action: Binding of erythropoietin to the erythropoietin receptor leads to receptor dimerization, which facilitates activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathways within the cytosol. Activated STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) proteins are then translocated to the nucleus where they serve as transcription factors which regulate the activation of specific genes involved in cell division or differentiation. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Antianemic Agents"}}
