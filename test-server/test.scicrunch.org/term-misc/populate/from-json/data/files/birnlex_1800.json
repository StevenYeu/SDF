The distinction as described by BFO, as we understand it, is that functions are end-directed activities of continuants.  So memory function is an end activity of a memory process.  We therefore measure memory function as an indicator of the effectiveness of the memory process.","CurationStatus":"uncurated","Umlscui":["C0025361"],"SuperCategory":"Behavioral process","Id":"birnlex_1800"}}
