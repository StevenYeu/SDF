It is effective in the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris, hypertension, and congestive cardiac failure. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Isradipine, the most potent calcium-channel blocking agent of the dihydropyridine class, is similar to nifedipine, amlodipine, and felodipine. It binds to calcium channels with high affinity and specificity and inhibits calcium flux into cardiac and smooth muscle. The effects observed in mechanistic experiments in vitro and studied in intact animals and man are compatible with this mechanism of action and are typical of the class. Mechanism of action: Possibly by deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and\/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, isradipine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across both the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes. The resultant inhibition of the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells leads to dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries and improved oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antihypertensive Agents. Calcium Channel Blockers. Vasodilator Agents"}}
