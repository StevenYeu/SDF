{"Isothermal titration calorimetry instrument":{"Synonym":"Isothermal titration calorimeter","Created":"2007-10-11","CurationStatus":"graph_position_temporary","SuperCategory":"Calorimetry instrument","Id":"birnlex_2427","Definition":"Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) is a biophysical technique used to determine the thermodynamic parameters of (biochemical) interactions. It is most often used to study the binding of small molecules (such as medicinal compounds) to larger macromolecules (proteins, DNA etc.). An isothermal titration calorimeter is composed of two identical cells made of a highly efficient thermal conducting material such as Hasteloy  alloy or gold, surrounded by an adiabatic jacket (reviewed by O'Brien et al, 2000). Sensitive thermopile\/ thermocouple circuits are used to detect temperature differences between the reference cell (filled with buffer or water) and the sample cell containing the macromolecule. Prior to addition of ligand, a constant power (<1 mW) is applied to the reference cell. This directs a feedback circuit, activating a heater located on the sample cell (VP-ITC users manual, MicroCal Inc, Northampton, MA, USA. 2001). During the experiment, ligand is titrated into the sample cell in precisely known aliquots, causing heat to be either taken up or evolved (depending on the nature of the reaction). Measurements consist of the time-dependent input of power required to maintain equal temperatures between the sample and reference cells."}}
