(PubChem) Pharmacology: Ofloxacin is a quinolone\/fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Ofloxacin is bactericidal and its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Notably the drug has 100 times higher affinity for bacterial DNA gyrase than for mammalian. Ofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanism of action: Ofloxacin acts on DNA gyrase, an enzyme which, like human topoisomerase, prevents the excessive supercoiling of DNA during replication or transcription. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents. Anti-Infective Agents, Urinary. Anti-Infectives. Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors. Quinolones"}}
