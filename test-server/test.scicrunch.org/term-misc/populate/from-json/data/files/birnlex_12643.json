{"Nervous System Paraneoplastic Syndrome":{"EditorialNote":"Note that all of teh progeny of this class are in fact neurodegenerative diseases.  In holding  with the \"realist\" orientation and the effort to represent the CORE subsumptive hierarchy as a related set of functional or function-structure classes - as opposed to using causal relations to specify nervous system disease - Nervous System Paraneoplastic Syndromes have been made a sub-class of neurodegerative disease as opposed to metastatic nervous system neoplastic disease.  Causal relations - such as specify a specific neoplastic condition as the cause for the resulting degeration of nervous system structure and function - will be provided via ObjectProperties.  Certain disorders which are in fact Nervous System Paraneoplastic Syndromes - e.g., Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome, Transverse Myelitis, Opsoclonus-Myoclonus Syndrome - are left as children of the functional disease categories based on the affected function (BB: 2007-10-06).","Created":"2007-10-05","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Neurodegenerative disease","Id":"birnlex_12643","DefiningCitation":"Intern Med 1996 Dec;35(12):925-9","Definition":"Degenerative or inflammatory conditions affecting the central or peripheral nervous system that develop in association with a systemic neoplasm without direct invasion by tumor.
