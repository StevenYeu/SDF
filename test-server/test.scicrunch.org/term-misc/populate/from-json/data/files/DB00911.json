(PubChem) Pharmacology: Tinidazole is a synthetic antiprotozoal agent. Tinidazole demonstrates activity both in vitro and in clinical infections against the following protozoa: Trichomonas vaginalis, Giardia duodenalis (also termed G. lamblia), and Entamoeba histolytica. Tinidazole does not appear to have activity against most strains of vaginal lactobacilli. Mechanism of action: Tinidazole is an antiprotozoal agent. The nitro group of tinidazole is reduced by cell extracts of Trichomonas. The free nitro radical generated as a result of this reduction may be responsible for the antiprotozoal activity. The mechanism by which tinidazole exhibits activity against Giardia and Entamoeba species is not known. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Alkylating Agents. Anti-Infectives. Antiprotozoals. Antitrichomonal Agents"}}
