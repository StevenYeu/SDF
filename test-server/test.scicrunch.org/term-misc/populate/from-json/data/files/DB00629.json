(PubChem) Pharmacology: Guanabenz, a centrally acting -2 adrenergic agonist, is indicated for treatment of hypertension. Mechanism of action: Guanabenz's antihypertensive effect is thought to be due to central alpha-adrenergic stimulation, which results in a decreased sympathetic outflow to the heart, kidneys, and peripheral vasculature in addition to a decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure and a slight slowing of pulse rate. Chronic administration of guanabenz also causes a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Adrenergic alpha-Agonists. Antihypertensive Agents. Sympatholytics"}}
