{"Scintillation detection instrument":{"Synonym":"Scintillation counter","Created":"2007-10-11","CurationStatus":"graph_position_temporary","SuperCategory":"Radiation detection instrument","Id":"birnlex_2453","Definition":"A scintillation counter measures ionizing radiation. The sensor, called a scintillator, consists of a transparent crystal, usually phosphor, plastic (usually containing anthracene), or organic liquid (see liquid scintillation counting) that fluoresces when struck by ionizing radiation. A sensitive photomultiplier tube (PMT) measures the light from the crystal. The PMT is attached to an electronic amplifier"}}
