Cloned and expressed in hamster kidney cells, the protein is catalytically active in a two-chain form. Pharmacology: Used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in hemophilia A or B. NovoSeven is recombinant Factor VIIa and, when complexed with tissue factor can activate coagulation Factor X to Factor Xa, as well as coagulation Factor IX to Factor IXa. Factor Xa, in complex with other factors, then converts prothrombin to thrombin, which leads to the formation of a hemostatic plug by converting fibrinogen to fibrin and thereby inducing local clotting. Mechanism of action: NovoSeven activates the coagulation or clotting cascade by cleaving Factor IX and Factor X, which activates them and then leads to activation of thrombin and fibrin. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Coagulants. Thrombotic Agents"}}
