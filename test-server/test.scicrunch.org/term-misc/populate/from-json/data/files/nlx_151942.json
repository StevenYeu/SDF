This is most easily appreciated in horizontal sections taken at dorsal levels.  The FC can be further subdivided into a portion that contains granular cells similar to those found in the dentate gyrus (DG), which we will refer to as FC-DG. A second part mainly contains pyramidal cells, and this is further subdivided in a large-celled area that has similarities to CA3, referred to as FC-CA3 and a small-celled portion, a look-alike of CA1, named FC-CA1. In some sections these subdivisions are not easy differentiated, in which case we will use FC to indicate the entire complex."}}
