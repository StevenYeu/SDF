It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, and antidepressant properties. Adinazolam was developed by Dr. Jackson B. Hester, who was seeking to enhance the antidepressant properties of alprazolam, which he also developed. Pharmacology: Adinazolam is a benzodiazepine derivative used to treat anxiety, status epilepticus, and for sedation induction and anterograde amnesia. Adinazolam binds with high affinity to the GABA benzodiazepine receptor complex. Considerable evidence suggest that the central pharmacologic\/therapeutic actions of alprazolam are mediated via interaction with this receptor complex. Mechanism of action: Adinazolam binds to peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors which interact allosterically with GABA receptors. This potentiates the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, increasing the inhibition of the ascending reticular activating system and blocking the cortical and limbic arousal that occurs following stimulation of the reticular pathways. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-anxiety Agents. Antidepressive Agents"}}
