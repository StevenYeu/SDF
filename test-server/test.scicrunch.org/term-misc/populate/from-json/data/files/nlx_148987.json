Its axon branches, with one branch innervating the ipsilateral antennal lobe glomeruli DL4 and DP1 medial compartment and the other fasciculating with the antennal commissure and innervating the contralateral antennal lobe glomeruli DC4 and DP1 medial compartment (Ai et al., 2010, Silbering et al., 2011). Its dendrite transduces signals from the grooved sensillum of chamber III of the sacculus (Shanbhag et al., 1995)."}}
