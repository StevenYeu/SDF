It is a powerful miotic used mainly in the treatment of glaucoma. Its vapor is highly toxic and it is recommended that only solutions in arachis oil be used therapeutically. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 29th ed, p1330) Pharmacology: Isoflurophate is used as ocular drops in the treatment of chronic glaucoma. Isoflurophate is an organophosphorus compound that acts as an irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor. As such, it displays parasympathomimetic effects. Isoflurophate is used in the eye to treat certain types of glaucoma and other eye conditions, such as accommodative esotropia. They may also be used in the diagnosis of certain eye conditions, such as accommodative esotropia. Isoflurophate damages the acetylcholinesterase enzyme and is therefore irreversible, however, pralidoxime can displace organophosphates such as isoflurophate from acetylcholinesterase, but only if administered before isoflurophate damages (alkylates) the enzyme. Mechanism of action: The mechanism of isoflurophate's action involves the irreversible inhibition of cholinesterase. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antiglaucomic Agents. Cholinesterase Inhibitors. Miotics. Ophthalmics. Protease Inhibitors"}}
