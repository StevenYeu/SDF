Temozolomide is not active until it is converted at physiologic pH to the active form, 5-(3-methyltriazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is due to alkylation of DNA at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine. Pharmacology: Temozolomide is an antineoplastic agent. It causes death of of rapidly replicating cells, especially malignant cells, leading to regression or slowed tumor growth. Mechanism of action: Temozolomide is not active until it is converted at physiologic pH to the active form, 5-(3-methyltriazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is due to alkylation of DNA at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antineoplastic Agents. Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating"}}
