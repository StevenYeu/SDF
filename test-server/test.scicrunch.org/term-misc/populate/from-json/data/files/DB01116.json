{"Trimethaphan":{"RelatedTo":"Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-10","Synonym":["Thimethaphan","Trimetaphan","Trimetaphanum"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB01116","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB01116","Definition":"A nicotinic antagonist that has been used as a ganglionic blocker in hypertension, as an adjunct to anesthesia, and to induce hypotension during surgery. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Trimethaphan is indicated for production of controlled hypotension during surgery to reduce bleeding into the surgical field and also for rapid reduction of blood pressure in the treatment of hypertensive emergencies, especially in patients with acute dissecting aneurysm, and in the emergency treatment of pulmonary edema in patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with systemic hypertension. Mechanism of action: Trimethaphan is a ganglionic blocking agent prevents stimulation of postsynaptic receptors by competing with acetylcholine for these receptor sites. Additional effects may include direct peripheral vasodilation and release of histamine. Trimethaphan's hypotensive effect is due to reduction in sympathetic tone and vasodilation, and is primarily postural. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Adjuvants, Anesthesia. Antihypertensive Agents. Ganglionic Blockers. Nicotinic Antagonists. Vasodilator Agents"}}
