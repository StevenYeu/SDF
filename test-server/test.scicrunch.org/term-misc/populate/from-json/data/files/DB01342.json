Forasartan competes with angiotensin II for binding at the AT1 receptor subtype. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor which also stimulates the synthesis and release of aldosterone, blockage of its effects results in a decreases in systemic vascular resistance. Pharmacology: Forasartan, a specific angiotensin II antagonist, is used alone or with other antihypertensive agents to treat hypertension. Mechanism of action: Forasartan competes with angiotensin II for binding at the AT1 receptor subtype. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor which also stimulates the synthesis and release of aldosterone, blockage of its effects results in a decreases in systemic vascular resistance. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists. Antihypertensive Agents"}}
