It is marketed as a 1% eye drop solution under the trade name Vexol Pharmacology: Rimexolone is a glucocorticoid corticosteroid for systemic use. Corticosteroids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents of a mechanical, chemical, or immunological nature. They inhibit edema, cellular infiltration, capillary dilatation, fibroblastic proliferation, deposition of collagen and scar formation associated with inflammation. Mechanism of action: Betamethasone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition of arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-inflammatory Agents. Corticosteroids"}}
