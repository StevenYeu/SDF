Rosoxacin is known to be effective against penicillin resistant strains and is a single dose orally administered drug, which avoids all complications of parenteral administration seen with penicillin, especially anaphylactic shock. Pharmacology: Rosoxacin is a nonfluorinated quinolone antibiotic. Its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Rosoxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanism of action: Rosoxacin binds to and inhibits the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Infective Agents"}}
