Pemirolast potassium is a slightly yellow powder soluble in water; as an ophthalmic aqueous sterile solution is used for the prevention of itching of the eyes caused by allergies such as hay fever, and allergic conjunctivitis. Pemirolast is potentially useful for prophylaxis of pulmonary hypersensitivity reactions to drugs such as paclitaxel. Pharmacology: Pemirolast is used for the prophylactic treatment of itching of the eye associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Pemirolast potassium is a mast cell stabilizer that inhibits the in vivo Type I immediate hypersensitivity reaction. Pemirolast inhibits the antigen-induced release of inflammatory mediators (e.g., histamine, leukotriene C4, D4, E4) from human mast cells. Allergic reactions lead to cell-degranulation and the release of histamine (and other chemical mediators) from the mast cell or basophil. Once released, histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors. Histamine, acting on H1-receptors, produces pruritis, vasodilatation, Pemirolast is a histamine H1 antagonist. It competes with histamine for the normal H1-receptor sites on effector cells of blood vessels. It provides effective, temporary relief of watery and itchy eyes. Mechanism of action: Pemirolast binds to the histamine H1 receptor. This blocks the action of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine. Pemirolast has also been observed to block antigen-stimulated calcium ion influx into mast cells. Pemirolast inhibits the chemotaxis of eosinophils into ocular tissue, and prevents inflammatory mediator release from human eosinophils. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule.
