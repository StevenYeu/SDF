{"Extracellular Amplifier":{"SuperCategory":"Amplifier","Comment":"Adapted from WPI http:\/\/www.wpiinc.com\/index.php\/Virtue-Mart\/vmchk.html","Id":"nlx_25008","Has role":"Instrument role","Definition":"Extracellular amplifiers are designed to amplify bio-potentials that occur within interstitial spaces, or to amplify field potentials at the surface of the cell membrane or on the surface of tissues. They typically have a very high input impedance and high voltage gain capability."}}
