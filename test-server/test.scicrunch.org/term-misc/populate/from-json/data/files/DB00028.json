The purification process includes cold alcohol fractionation, polyethylene glycol precipitation, and ion exchange chromatography. Flebogamma contains the IgG antibody specificities found in the general human population. IgG subclasses are fully represented in the following proportions: IgG1 is 70.3%, IgG2, 24.7%, IgG3, 3.1%, and IgG4,1.9% Pharmacology: Used as a replacement therapy in inherited humoral immunodeficiency disorders such as severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, x-linked agammaglobulinemia, and Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome. The immune globulins target, bind and kill bacterial cells as well as viral particles. IgG is the monomeric immunoglobulin of which there are four subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4) in differing abundances (66%, 23%, 7% and 4%). IgAs represent about 15% of the immunoglobulins in the blood. These target inhaled or ingested pathogens. Mechanism of action: Antibodies prevent infection by attaching to the surface of invading pathogens and aiding in their disposal before they can infect cells. Antibodies remove pathogens via complement activation, agglutination or precipitation, pathogen receptor blocking, macrophage tagging or neutralization (via binding) of pathogen toxins. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Anti-Infectives. Immunomodulatory Agents"}}
