The cell body fiber runs dorsally on the anterior surface of the gamma lobe, with one branch innervating the middle part of the gamma lobe. Another branch further bifurcates on the dorsal surface of the medial lobe. One of these branches terminates in the inferior neuropils behind the medial lobe, whilst the other turns medially through the border between the gamma and beta' lobes and enters the opposite hemisphere. The fibers from the opposite hemisphere run horizontally, enter the medial lobe through border between the gamma and beta' lobes and forms arborization in the middle part of the gamma lobe.","hasDBXref":"FlyBrain_NDB:10455"}}
