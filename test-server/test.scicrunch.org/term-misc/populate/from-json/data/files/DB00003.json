Delivered by aerosol mist. The protein is produced by genetically engineered Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells containing DNA encoding for the native human protein, deoxyribonuclease I (DNase). 260 residues Pharmacology: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease characterized by the retention of viscous purulent secretions in the airways. These thick secretions contribute both to reduced pulmonary function and to frequent pulmonary infection. Purulent pulmonary secretions contain very high concentrations of extracellular DNA released by degenerating leukocytes that accumulate in response to these infections. Dornase Alfa hydrolyzes the DNA in sputum of CF patients and reduces sputum viscoelasticity. Mechanism of action: Dornase Alfa hydrolyzes DNA, thereby degrading large, viscous DNA molecules into small, soluble fragments that are easily cleared from the lungs. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Enzyme Replacement Agents"}}
