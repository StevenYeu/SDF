{"Nervous system neoplastic disease":{"Created":"2007-10-05","EditorialNote":"This entire branch will ultimately be vetted against the NCI Thesaurus and reviewed with NCICB staff working on representation for nervous system neoplasms (2007-10-05)., Despite the fact most of the subclasses for neoplastic disease appear to be representing an object (the neoplasm itself), they should be considered to be representing the disposition for a given tissue to develop such a neoplasm.  It is left for the future as to how this disposition will be linked to the tissue bearing that disposition.  Again - we will consult those working on a realist representation of neoplastic disorders for insight and guidance on this task (BB: 2007-10-05).","Synonym":"Cancer","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Nervous system disease","Id":"birnlex_12525","Definition":"Abnormal mass of tissue in the nervous system."}}
