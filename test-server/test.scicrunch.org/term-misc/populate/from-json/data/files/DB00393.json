It has marked cerebrovascular dilating effects and lowers blood pressure. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Nimodipine belongs to the class of pharmacological agents known as calcium channel blockers. Nimodipine is indicated for the improvement of neurological outcome by reducing the incidence and severity of ischemic deficits in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage from ruptured congenital aneurysms who are in good neurological condition post-ictus (e.g., Hunt and Hess Grades I-III). The contractile processes of smooth muscle cells are dependent upon calcium ions, which enter these cells during depolarization as slow ionic transmembrane currents. Nimodipine inhibits calcium ion transfer into these cells and thus inhibits contractions of vascular smooth muscle. In animal experiments, nimodipine had a greater effect on cerebral arteries than on arteries elsewhere in the body perhaps because it is highly lipophilic, allowing it to cross the blood brain barrier. Mechanism of action: Although the precise mechanism of action is not known, nimodipine blocks intracellular influx of calcium that is thought to be a central to ischaemic neuronal damage. Nimodipine binds specifically to L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antihypertensive Agents. Calcium Channel Blockers. Vasodilator Agents"}}
