{"BSD License":{"Created":"2007-10-11","EditorialNote":"Note as of 2006, the BSD License is equivalent to the MIT License","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Open-source license","Id":"birnlex_2350","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.opensource.org\/licenses\/bsd-license.php","Xref":"NITRC_187","Definition":"BSD licenses represent a family of permissive free software licenses, placing few restrictions on the developer or user.  As a developer, you may distribute source or binaries (with or without source code).  As a tool user, you may modify and redistribute this tool or resource.  If source code is distributed, a user may browse the source code to understand the tool's workings, modify the tool to better suit local needs, and share a modified version.  If source code is not distributed, a user may still redistribute the tool as part of another package. (NITRC)<BR>The original BSD license was used for the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), a Unix-like operating system for which the license is named. The first version of the license was revised, and the resulting licenses are more properly called modified BSD licenses. Permissive licenses, sometimes with important differences pertaining to license compatibility, are referred to as \"BSD-style licenses\". Several BSD-like licenses, including the New BSD license, have been vetted by the Open Source Initiative as meeting their definition of open source. The licenses have few restrictions compared to other free software licenses such as the GNU General Public License or even the default restrictions provided by copyright, putting it relatively closer to the public domain."}}
