Pharmacology: Troleandomycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is similar to erythromycin. It is active in vitro against the following gram-positive organisms: Streptococcus pyogenes and Diplococcus pneumoniae. Mechanism of action: Troleandomycin acts by penetrating the bacterial cell membrane and reversibly binding to the 50 S subunit of bacterial ribosomes or near the \"P\" or donor site so that binding of tRNA (transfer RNA) to the donor site is blocked. Translocation of peptides from the \"A\" or acceptor site to the \"P\" or donor site is prevented, and subsequent protein synthesis is inhibited. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents. Antibacterial Agents. Macrolides"}}
