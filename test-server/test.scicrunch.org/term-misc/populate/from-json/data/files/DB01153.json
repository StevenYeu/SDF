It is available as a cream to treat skin infections such as athlete's foot. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Sertaconazole is an imidazole\/triazole type antifungal agent. Sertaconazole is a highly selective inhibitor of fungal cytochrome P-450 sterol C-14 -demethylation via the inhibition of the enzyme cytochrome P450 14-demethylase. This enzyme converts lanosterol to ergosterol, and is required in fungal cell wall synthesis. The subsequent loss of normal sterols correlates with the accumulation of 14 -methyl sterols in fungi and may be partly responsible for the fungistatic activity of fluconazole. Mammalian cell demethylation is much less sensitive to fluconazole inhibition. Sertaconazole exhibits in vitro activity against Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida spp. Fungistatic activity has also been demonstrated in normal and immunocompromised animal models for systemic and intracranial fungal infections due to Cryptococcus neoformans and for systemic infections due to Candida albicans. Mechanism of action: Sertaconazole interacts with 14- demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme necessary to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. As ergosterol is an essential component of the fungal cell membrane, inhibition of its synthesis results in increased cellular permeability causing leakage of cellular contents. Sertaconazole may also inhibit endogenous respiration, interact with membrane phospholipids, inhibit the transformation of yeasts to mycelial forms, inhibit purine uptake, and impair triglyceride and\/or phospholipid biosynthesis.
