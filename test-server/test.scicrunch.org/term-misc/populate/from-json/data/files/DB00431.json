It has been shown to cause cancer. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Scabies is a common, highly pruritic infestation of the skin caused by Sarcoptes scabiei (lice). It is a very contagious condition with specific lesions, such as burrows, and nonspecific lesions, such as papules, vesicles and excoriations. The typical areas of the body it affects are finger webs, scalp (hair), wrists, axillary folds, abdomen, buttocks, inframammary folds and genitalia (males). It is characterized by intense night-time itching. Scabies is spread through close personal contact (relatives, sexual partners, schoolchildren, chronically ill patients and crowded communities). Scabies infestations and the corresponding symptoms can be eliminated by killing the scabies with topical insecticides or scabicides. Lindane is a scabicide that is essentially and organochloride insecticide. Mechanism of action: Lindane is an organochloride insecticide that exerts its parasiticidal action by being directly absorbed into the parasites (primarily lice, or scabies) and their ova. The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(1)) receptor\/chloride ionophore complex is the primary site of action for lindane, and other insecticides such as endosulfan, and fipronil. Blockage of the GABA-gated chloride channel reduces neuronal inhibition, which leads to hyperexcitation of the central nervous system, convulsions, and death. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antiscabies Agent. Insecticides. Scabicide"}}
