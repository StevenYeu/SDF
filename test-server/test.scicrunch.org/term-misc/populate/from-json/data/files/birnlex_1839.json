{"Oculomotor function":{"Created":"2007-08-22","Synonym":["Eye movement system"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","Umlscui":["C0683208"],"SuperCategory":"Motor system function","Id":"birnlex_1839","Definition":"The oculomotor system consists of six extraocular muscles attached to the orbit and to the eyeball, extraocular motor neurons located in three different brainstem motor nuclei, and premotor centers and circuits involved in the generation and control of the different types of eye movement. Its exact functional design and robust biomechanics have allowed this motor system to survive, almost unchanged, across different trends in vertebrate evolution (http:\/\/www.els.net\/WileyCDA\/ElsArticle\/refId-a0002968.html)."}}
