{"Universal Trial Number":{"Synonym":"UTRN","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Identifying value","Id":"nlx_151506","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.who.int\/ictrp\/unambiguous_identification\/utn\/en\/","Abbrev":"UTN","Definition":"The aim of the Universal Trial Number (UTN) is to facilitate the unambiguous identification of clinical trials. The UTN is not a registration number.The UTN is a number that should be obtained early in the history of the trial. The UTN should:* become permanently attached to the trial* be used whenever information about the trial is communicated* become part of the trial's identity* be documented in the trial protocol* be submitted every time the trial is registeredIt is recognized that some UTNs will be attached to trials that do not progress; that is, trials that never become fully developed protocols and that never recruit participants. Some UTNs will therefore never appear attached to a registered trial."}}
