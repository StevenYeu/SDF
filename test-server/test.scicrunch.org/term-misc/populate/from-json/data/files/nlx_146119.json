These include all combinations of (100 and 200) point rewards with (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1) probabilities, plus 300 and 400 rewards with 0.5 probability. Participants are first trained to learn the probabilities and outcomes associated with each stimulus. Next, on each trial, a stimulus appears in one of four quadrants of the screen, and participants indicate which quadrant using a button press"}}
