{"Lewy Body-like Hyaline Inclusion":{"SuperCategory":"Cellular Inclusion","Id":"nlx_169","DefiningCitation":"Kato S. 2008. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis models and human neuropathology: similarities and differences. Acta Neuropathol 115:97-114. PMID 18026741","Abbrev":"LBHI","Definition":"In H&E preparations, neuronal LBHIs show an eosinphilic core with a paler peripheral halo, and their name is derived from their H&E staining features, which resemble those of Lewy bodies in patients with Parkinson's disease. Neuronal Lewy Body-like Hyaline Inclusions consist of filaments and granular materials, exhibit dense cores with rough preipheral halos and lack a limiting membrane.  The filaments of these inclusions are composed of approximately 15-25 nm granule-coated fibrils in association with normal 10-nm neurofilaments."}}
