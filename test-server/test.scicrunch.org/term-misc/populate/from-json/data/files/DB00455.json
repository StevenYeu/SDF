Unlike most classical antihistamines (histamine H1 antagonists) it lacks central nervous system depressing effects such as drowsiness. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Loratadine, a non-sedating H1-blocker similar in structure to cyproheptadine and azatadine, is used to treat seasonal allergic rhinitis. Unlike other H1-blockers, loratidine does not penetrate the CNS effectively and has a low affinity for CNS H1-receptors. Mechanism of action: Like other H1-blockers, loratadine competes with free histamine for binding at H1-receptors in the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial muscle. Loratadine also has a weak affinity for acetylcholine and alpha-adrenergic receptors. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Allergic Agents. Antihistamines. Antipruritics. Histamine H1 Antagonists, Non-Sedating"}}
