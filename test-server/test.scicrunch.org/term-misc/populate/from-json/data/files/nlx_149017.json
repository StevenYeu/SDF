Its thin processes run ventrally before bifurcating into two main collateral branches which innervate the superior lateral and median protocerebrum, the region around the mushroom body pedunculus and the mushroom body calyx. There is one neuron per hemisphere (de Haro et al., 2010).","hasDBXref":"VFB:FBbt_00110058"}}
