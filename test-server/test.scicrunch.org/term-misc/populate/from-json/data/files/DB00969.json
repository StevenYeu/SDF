Alosetron has an antagonist action on the 5-HT3 receptors of the enteric nervous system of the gastrointestinal tract. Pharmacology: Alosetron is a potent and selective antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor type. Activation of these receptors affects the regulation of visceral pain, colonic transit, and GI secretions. By blocking these receptors, alosetron is able to effectively control IBS. Mechanism of action: Alosetron is a potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. 5-HT3 receptors are nonselective cation channels that are extensively distributed on enteric neurons in the human gastrointestinal tract, as well as other peripheral and central locations. Activation of these channels and the resulting neuronal depolarization affect the regulation of visceral pain, colonic transit and gastrointestinal secretions, processes that relate to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as alosetron inhibit activation of non-selective cation channels which results in the modulation of the enteric nervous system. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Withdrawn. Drug category: Gastrointestinal Agents. Serotonin Antagonists"}}
