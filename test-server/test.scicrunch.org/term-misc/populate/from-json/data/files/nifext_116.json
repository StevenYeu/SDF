It is a small bipolar cell in the pseudostratified olfactory epithelium, with cell body 8-15 um diameter giving rise to a single dendrite ending in a knob at the epithelial surface, from which arise several sensory cilia.  A single unmyelinated axon descends through the basal lamina and turns to project to the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb.  Shepherd, Chen & Greer.
