{"Retapamulin":{"RelatedTo":"50S ribosomal protein L3","Synonym":["SB 275833"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB01256","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB01256","Definition":"Retapamulin is a topical antibiotic developed by GlaxoSmithKline. It was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in April 2007 for the treatment of bacterial skin infections such as impetigo. It is marketed as an ointment under the name brand Altabax. It works by inhibiting the bacterial 50S ribosomal unit by binding to the 23S RNA. This prevents peptide synthesis. Pharmacology: Retapamulin is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor belonging to a class of compounds called pleuromutilins. These compounds act by inhibiting the initiation of protein synthesis at the level of bacterial 50S ribosome. Mechanism of action: Retapamulin is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor belonging to a class of compounds called pleuromutilins. These compounds act by inhibiting the initiation of protein synthesis at the level of bacterial 50S ribosome. This binding site involves ribosomal protein L3 and is in the region of the ribosomal P site and peptidyl transferase center. By virtue of binding to this site, pleuromutilins inhibit peptidyl transfer, block P-site interactions, and prevent the normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antibacterial Agents"}}
