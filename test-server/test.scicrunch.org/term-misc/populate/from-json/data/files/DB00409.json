It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Remoxipride, a substituted benzamide, is a selective D2 receptor antagonist. It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia. Some antipsychotics block domapinergic receptors as well as cholinergic, noradrenergic and histaminergic receptors. Remoxipride was developed to act specifically on the dopamine D2 receptor. As a consequence, several undesired side effects can occur. Patients often feel they are not taking any antipsychotic drug. It has a potent affinity for the sigma receptor, but it is unclear whether it is a sigma agonist or antagonist. The contribution of this property to its clinical profile is unknown. Blocking the D2 dopamine receptor is known to cause relapse in patients that have achieved remission from depression, and such blocking also counteracts the effectiveness of SSRI medication. Mechanism of action: Remoxipride acts as an antagonist at the D2 dopamine receptor. It is believed that overactivity of dopamine systems in the mesolimbic pathway may contribute to the \"positive symptoms\" of schizophrenia (such as delusions and hallucinations), whereas problems with dopamine function in the mesocortical pathway may be responsible for the \"negative symptoms\", such as avolition, flat emotional response and alogia. Therefore, by decreasing the levels of dopamine in these pathways, it is thought that remoxipride is able to reduce the symptoms of schizophrenia. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Withdrawn.
