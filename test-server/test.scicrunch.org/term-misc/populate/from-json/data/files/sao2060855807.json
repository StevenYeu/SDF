{"Calreticulin":{"Synonym":"CRP55; Calregulin; Calreticulin precursor; ERp60; HACBP; grp60","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Id":"sao2060855807","Has role":"Calcium Binding Protein,","Definition":"A multifunctional protein that is found primarily within membrane-bound organelles.  In the endoplasmic reticulum it binds to specific N-linked oligosaccharides found on newly-synthesized proteins and functions as a molecular chaperone that may play a role in protein folding or retention and degradation of misfolded proteins.  In addition calreticulin is a major storage form for calcium and functions as a calcium-signaling molecule that can regulate intracellular calcium homeostasis (MSH)."}}
