It attains high serum levels and is excreted quickly via the urine. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Cefazolin (also known as cefazoline or cephazolin) is a semi-synthetic cephalosporin for parenteral administration. Cefazolin has broad-spectrum antibiotic action due to inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. It attains high serum levels and is excreted quickly via the urine. Mechanism of action: In vitro tests demonstrate that the bactericidal action of cephalosporins results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, it inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents. Cephalosporins"}}
