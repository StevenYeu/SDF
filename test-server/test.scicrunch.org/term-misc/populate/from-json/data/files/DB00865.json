It is used in the treatment of obesity. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1222) Pharmacology: Benzphetamine, a phenylalkylamin, is related to amphetamine both chemically and pharmacologically. It is an anorectic agent indicated in the management of exogenous obesity as a short term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on caloric restriction. Benzphetamine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, the amphetamines. Actions include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. Mechanism of action: Although the mechanism of action of the sympathomimetic appetite suppressants in the treatment of obesity is not fully known, these medications have pharmacological effects similar to those of amphetamines. Amphetamine and related sympathomimetic medications (such as benzphetamine) are thought to stimulate the release of norepinephrine and\/or dopamine from storage sites in nerve terminals in the lateral hypothalamic feeding center, thereby producing a decrease in appetite. This release is mediated by the binding of benzphetamine to centrally located adrenergic receptors. Drug type: Approved. Illicit. Small Molecule. Drug category: Adrenergic Agents.
