Equivalent to the periglomerular cell of the main olfactory bulb, but the glomeruli are less clearly differentiated.  The cell body is 6-8 um in diameter, from which arises a short bushy dendrite that arborizes within a glomerulus, where it receives synaptic input from olfactory receptor cell axon terminals, and engages in dendrodendritic interactions with mitral\/tufted cell dendrites. The axon distributes laterally within the extraglomerular region. Shepherd, Chen, Greer. Olfactory bulb. In The synaptic organization of the brain, ed 5 New York: Oxford University Press, 2004."}}
