The cell body fiber is sent ventrally towards the medial lobe. Arborizations occur in the inferior neuropils just dorsal to the beta' lobe. The main fiber enters the mushroom body between the gamma and beta' lobes and forms terminals in the medial segment of the beta' lobe. Fibers then further run medially to the opposite beta' lobe. There are two of these per hemisphere.","hasDBXref":"FlyBrain_NDB:10457"}}
