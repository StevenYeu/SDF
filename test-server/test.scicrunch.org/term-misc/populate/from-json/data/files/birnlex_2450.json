{"X-Ray crystallography instrument":{"Synonym":"X-Ray diffraction instrument","Created":"2007-10-11","CurationStatus":"graph_position_temporary","SuperCategory":"Chemical structural analysis instrument","Id":"birnlex_2450","Definition":"is the science of determining the arrangement of atoms within a crystal from the manner in which a beam of X-rays is scattered from the electrons within the crystal. The method produces a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal, from which the mean atomic positions, their chemical bonds, their disorder and sundry other information can be derived. The technique of single-crystal X-ray crystallography has three basic steps. The first, and often most difficult, step is to obtain an adequate crystal of the material under study. The crystal should be sufficiently large, pure in composition and regular in structure, with no large internal imperfections such as cracks or twinning. In the second step, the crystal is placed in an intense beam of X-rays, usually of a single wavelength (monochromatic X-rays), producing the regular pattern of reflections. As the crystal is gradually rotated, previous reflections disappear and new ones appear; the intensity of every spot is recorded meticulously at every orientation of the crystal. Multiple data sets may have to be collected, with each set covering slightly more than half a full rotation of the crystal and containing tens of thousands of reflection intensities. In the third step, these data are combined computationally with complementary chemical information to produce and refine a model of the arrangement of atoms within the crystal. The final, refined model, now called a crystal structure, is usually stored in a public database."}}
