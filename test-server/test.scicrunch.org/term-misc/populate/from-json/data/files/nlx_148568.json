Members of this group send processes to various parts of the brain: one group send processes to the calyx, the inferior portion of the lateral horn and broad areas in the middle superior medial protocerebrum, another group sends processes to the calyx, the entire lateral horn and broad areas of the middle superior protocerebrum, another subgroup innervates the lobula and broad protocerebral areas, and a final group innervates the posterior lateral protocerebrum.","hasDBXref":"VFB:FBbt_00100220"}}
