While its specific mechanism of action is unknown, it is believed paliperidone and risperidone act via similar, if not the same, pathways. It has been proposed that the drug's therapeutic activity in schizophrenia ismediated through a combination of central dopamine Type 2 (D2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2A) receptor antagonism. Paliperidone is also active as an antagonist at alpha 1 and alpha 2 adrenergic receptors and H1 histaminergic receptors, which may explain some of the other effects of the drug. Paliperidone was approved by the FDA for treatment of schizophrenia on December 20, 2006. Pharmacology: Paliperidone is an atypical antipsychotic developed by Janssen Pharmaceutica. Chemically, paliperidone is primary active metabolite of the older antipsychotic risperidone (paliperidone is 9-hydroxyrisperidone, i.e. risperidone with an extra hydroxyl group). While its specific mechanism of action is unknown, it is believed paliperidone and risperidone act via similar, if not the same, pathways. Mechanism of action: Paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone. The mechanism of action of paliperidone, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, is unknown, but it has been proposed that the drug's therapeutic activity in schizophrenia ismediated through a combination of central dopamine Type 2 (D2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2A) receptor antagonism. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antipsychotic Agents"}}
