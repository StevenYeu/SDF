Zonisamide may be a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor although this is not one of the primary mechanisms of action. Zonisamide may act by blocking repetitive firing of voltage-gated sodium channels leading to a reduction of T-type calcium channel currents, or by binding allosterically to GABA receptors. This latter action may inhibit the uptake of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA while enhancing the uptake of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Pharmacology: Zonisamide is an antiseizure drug chemically classified as a sulfonamide and unrelated to other antiseizure agents. The precise mechanism by which zonisamide exerts its antiseizure effect is unknown, although it is believed that the drug blocks sodium channels which leads to the suppression of neuronal hypersynchronization (i.e. convulsions). Likewise zonisamide has also been found not to potentiate syanptic activity by GABA (gamma amino butyric acid). Mechanism of action: Zonisamide binds to sodium channels, voltage sensitive calcium channels and to a lesser extent carbonic anhydrase. This blocks or suppresses neuronal depolarization and hypersynchronization. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anticonvulsants. Antioxidants"}}
