When taken with meals, sevelamer binds to dietary phosphate and prevents its absorption. It is marketed by Genzyme under the trade name Renagel. Pharmacology: Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) retain phosphorus and can develop hyperphosphatemia. High serum phosphorus can precipitate serum calcium resulting in ectopic calcification. When the product of serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations (Ca x P) exceeds 55 mg2\/dL2, there is an increased risk that ectopic calcification will occur. Hyperphosphatemia plays a role in the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal insufficiency. An increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels is characteristic of patients with chronic renal failure. Increased levels of PTH can lead to osteitis fibrosa, a bone disease. A decrease in serum phosphorus may decrease serum PTH levels. Treatment of hyperphosphatemia includes reduction in dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of intestinal phosphate absorption with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate with dialysis. Sevelamer taken with meals has been shown to decrease serum phosphorus concentrations in patients with ESRD who are on hemodialysis. In vitro studies have shown that the capsule and tablet formulations bind phosphate to a similar extent. Sevelamer treatment also results in a lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total serum cholesterol levels. Mechanism of action: Sevelamer prevents hyperphosphatemia by binding to dietary phosphate in the gut, preventing its absorption and thus decreasing serum parathyroid hormone levels. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Phosphate Binders"}}
