Pharmacology: Panitumumab is a recombinant, human IgG2 kappa monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). Overexpression of EGFR is detected in many human cancers, including those of the colon and rectum. When Panitumumab binds to EGFR it competitively inhibits the binding of ligands for EGFR. This results in inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine and vascular growth factor production. Mechanism of action: Panitumumab binds specifically to EGFR on both normal and tumor cells, and competitively inhibits the binding of ligands for EGFR. Nonclinical studies show that binding of panitumumab to the EGFR prevents ligand-induced receptor autophosphorylation and activation of receptor-associated kinases, resulting in inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine and vascular growth factor production, and internalization of the EGFR. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Antineoplastic Agents"}}
