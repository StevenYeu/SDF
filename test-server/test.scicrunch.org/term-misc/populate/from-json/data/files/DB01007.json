Tioconazole topical (skin) preparations are also available for ringworm, jock itch, athlete's foot, and tinea versicolor or \"sun fungus\". Tioconazole interacts with 14-  demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme that converts lanosterol to ergosterol, an essential component of the yeast membrane. In this way, tioconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis, resulting in increased cellular permeability. Pharmacology: Tioconazole is a broad-spectrum imidazole antifungal agent that inhibits the growth of human pathogenic yeasts. Tioconazole exhibits fungicidal activity in vitro against Candida albicans, other species of the genus Candida, and against Torulopsis glabrata. Tioconazole prevents the growth and function of some fungal organisms by interfering with the production of substances needed to preserve the cell membrane. This drug is effective only for infections caused by fungal organisms. It will not work for bacterial or viral infections. Mechanism of action: Tioconazole interacts with 14- demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme that converts lanosterol to ergosterol, an essential component of the yeast membrane. In this way, tioconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis, resulting in increased cellular permeability. Tioconazole may also inhibit endogenous respiration, interact with membrane phospholipids, inhibit the transformation of yeasts to mycelial forms and the uptake of purine, impair triglyceride and\/or phospholipid biosynthesis, and inhibit the movement of calcium and potassium ions across the cell membrane by blocking the ion transport pathway known as the Gardos channel. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antifungal Agents"}}
