{"Inbred mouse strain":{"Created":"2006-10-05","EditorialNote":"Currently (2006-10-07), the children of this class have been made mutually disjoint. In reality, there may be some mixing amongst strains - e.g., some strains and substrains were derived from crosses of other inbred strains. Ultimately, the disjoint sets will need to be worked out very carefully, but this approximately is kept for now as it will likely do no harm and serve as a reminder that this issue may require more thorough review in the future.","Synonym":["C57BL\/6J","C57BL\/6NJ"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","Contributor":"Robert W.
