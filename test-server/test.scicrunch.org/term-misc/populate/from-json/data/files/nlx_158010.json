{"Record collection":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Collection","Id":"nlx_158010","Keywords":"Resource:CINERGI","Definition":"An identified unit of information that describes some domain entity of interest, represented in an electronic form for use in computer information systems.  Distinction of data vs. metadata is based on the intention of the provider; metadata is intended as documentation of resources to support discovery (at the dataset level), evaluation (quality, provenance, fitness for purpose), and access (how do I get it?).  This resource type is included as a general category for use in filtering; probably shouldn't be a choice in pick lists for describing resources."}}
