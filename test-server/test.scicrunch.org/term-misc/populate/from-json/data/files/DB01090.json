(PubChem) Pharmacology: Pentolinium acts as a ganglionic blocking agent. Pentolinium inhibits release of adrenaline and noradrenaline from adrenergic nerves. It is used as an antihypertensive, and can be administered orally, intramuscularly, and subcutaneously. Mechanism of action: Pentolinium binds to the nicotinic (ganglion) acetylcholine receptor. This receptor\/channel is permeable to a range of divalent cations including calcium, the influx of which may activate a potassium current which hyperpolarizes the cell membrane. Blockage of the receptor leads to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilaton. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antihypertensive Agents. Ganglionic Blockers. Nicotinic Antagonists"}}
