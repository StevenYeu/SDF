The nucleus wraps around the anterior commissure. It is bounded laterally by the internal capsule, medially by the lateral septal nucleus and the anterior column of the fornix, and dorsally by the head of the caudate nucleus and the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle. Some authors have expanded the definition on the basis of other stains and connectivity studies to include cell groups distributed through the dorsal part of substantia innominata between the classical nucleus and the amygdala. The extended nucleus of stria terminalis by that definition is classified as part of the extended amygdala ( Olmos-2004 ). The nucleus is found in the human, the macaque, the rat and the mouse.
