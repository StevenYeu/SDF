{"Diencephalon of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["diencephalon p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151523","Is part of":"Forebrain of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"The diencephalon can be segmented in coronal T2-weighted MRI. The rostral border is defined by the emergence of the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, which appears as a bright spot just caudal to the fornix and medial to the stria medullaris. This small area rapidly expands caudally in to a large rectangular region bounded laterally by the darker internal capsulae, dorsally by the ventricles and the ventral hippocampal commissure, and ventrally by a more subtle border with the hypothalamus, which can be arbitrarily estimated as a horizontal line between the medial lemnisci. Further caudally the lateral border is defined by a thin sliver of lateral ventricle and the dark appearing fimbria. The caudal border of the diencephalon with the midbrain is the most difficult part of this segmentation. Moving caudally, the midbrain begins to define the ventral border of the diencephalon just as the substantia nigra (light on T2) comes in to view. Slightly more caudal, at roughly the caudal-most extent of the mammillary bodies, the slightly brighter superior colliculus emerges as the dorsal border of the diencephalon. Still further caudal the dorsal and ventral parts of the midbrain move closer together as the diencephalon disappears. Finally, near the caudal border of the substantia nigra all that remains of the diencephalon is the geniculate nuclei, which are light appearing protrusions from the midbrain in to the hippocampus."}}
