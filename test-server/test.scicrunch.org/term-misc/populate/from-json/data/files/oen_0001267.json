{"Slow wave potential":{"Synonym":"slow wave potential","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Membrane potential","Id":"oen_0001267","Definition":"A membrane potential that cycles between depolarizations and repolarizations. Slow wave potentials are generated by myocytes. Due to temporal summation, a slow wave potential will periodically reach threshold and generate an action potential.
