On hydrolysis it yields neamine and neobiosamine B. (From Merck Index, 11th ed) Pharmacology: Framycetin is used for the treatment of bacterial eye infections such as conjunctivitis. Framycetin is an antibiotic. It is not active against fungi, viruses and most kinds of anaerobic bacteria. Framycetin works by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, causing misreading of t-RNA, leaving the bacterium unable to synthesize proteins vital to its growth. Framycetin is useful primarily in infections involving aerobic bacteria bacteria. Mechanism of action: Framycetin binds to specific 30S-subunit proteins and 16S rRNA, four nucleotides of 16S rRNA and a single amino acid of protein S12. This interferes with decoding site in the vicinity of nucleotide 1400 in 16S rRNA of 30S subunit. This region interacts with the wobble base in the anticodon of tRNA. This leads to interference with the initiation complex, misreading of mRNA so incorrect amino acids are inserted into the polypeptide leading to nonfunctional or toxic peptides and the breakup of polysomes into nonfunctional monosomes.
