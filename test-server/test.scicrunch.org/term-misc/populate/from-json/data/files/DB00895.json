The quantitation of in vitro IgE antibodies to the benzylpenicilloyl determinant is a useful tool for evaluating allergic subjects. Pharmacology: Benylpenicilloyl polylysine is penicilloyl bound to polylysine and is considered to be the major determinant of penicillin metabolism; it is used as a skin-testing reagent to detect immunoglobulin E antibodies in people with a history of penicillin allergy. If skin testing using benzylpenicilloyl and penicillin G (as the sole source of minor determinants) is negative, approximately 97% of patients with a negative skin test will tolerate penicillin. Mechanism of action: The skin test for penicillin demonstrates the presence or absence of specific IgE antibodies to major and minor penicillin determinants. IgE antibodies to major determinants can be detected by using benzylpenicilloyl polylysine. A penicillin skin test predicts only the presence of IgE antibodies for the major or minor penicillin determinants at the time of application and does not predict the future development of IgE-mediated reactions during subsequent courses of penicillin. Benzylpenicilloyl polylysine reacts specifically with penicilloyl skin sensitizing antibodies (reagins) to produce immediate wheal and flare reactions which may reflect increased risk of allergic reactions to subsequent penicillin therapy.
