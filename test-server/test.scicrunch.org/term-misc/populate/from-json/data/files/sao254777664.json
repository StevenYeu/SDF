{"Schmidtt-Lanterman Cleft":{"SuperCategory":"Cellular Space","Id":"sao254777664","Definition":"From Reactime:  Regions within compact myelin in which the cytoplasmic faces of the enveloping myelin sheath are not tightly juxtaposed, and include cytoplasm from the cell responsible for making the myelin. Schmidt-Lanterman clefts occur in the compact myelin internode, while lateral loops are analogous structures found in the paranodal region adjacent to the nodes of Ranvier."}}
