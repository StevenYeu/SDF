The cell body fiber arborizes in the inferior and superior neuropils. The main fiber runs medially towards the tip of the medial lobe. Before entering the beta lobe, fibers branch off to project to the opposite hemisphere. The fibers entering the beta lobe arborize in the medial segment.","hasDBXref":"FlyBrain_NDB:10456"}}
