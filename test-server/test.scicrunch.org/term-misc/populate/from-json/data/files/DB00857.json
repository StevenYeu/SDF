It is highly lipophilic in nature and tends to accumulate in skin, nails, and fatty tissues. Like other allylamines, terbinafine inhibits ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting the fungal squalene epoxidase, an enzyme that is part of the fungal cell wall synthesis pathway. Pharmacology: Terbinafine is an allylamine antifungal agent and acts by inhibiting squalene epoxidase, thus blocking the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes. in vitro, mammalian squalene epoxidase is only inhibited at higher (4000 fold) concentrations than is needed for inhibition of the dermatophyte enzyme. Depending on the concentration of the drug and the fungal species test in vitro, Terbinafine may be fungicidal. However, the clinical significance of in vitro data is unknown. Mechanism of action: Terbinafine is hypothesized to act by inhibiting squalene epoxidase, thus blocking the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes.
