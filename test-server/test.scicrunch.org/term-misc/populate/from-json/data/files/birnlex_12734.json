{"Benign Neonatal Epilepsy":{"Synonym":"Benign Neonatal Convulsions","Created":"2007-10-08","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Epilepsy","Id":"birnlex_12734","DefiningCitation":["Adams et al.","Principles of Neurology","6th ed"],"Definition":"A condition marked by recurrent seizures that occur during the first 4-6 weeks of life despite an otherwise benign neonatal course. Autosomal dominant familial and sporadic forms have been identified. Seizures generally consist of brief episodes of tonic posturing and other movements, apnea, eye deviations, and blood pressure fluctuations. These tend to remit after the 6th week of life. The risk of developing epilepsy at an older age is moderately increased in the familial form of this disorder (MeSH)."}}
