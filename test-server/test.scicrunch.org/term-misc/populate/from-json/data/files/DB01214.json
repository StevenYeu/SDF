It is used as an antiarrhythmic, antihypertensive, and antiglaucoma agent. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Metipranolol is a beta1 and beta2 (non-selective) adrenergic receptor-blocking agent that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. Metipranolol is indicated in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma. Metipranolol, when applied topically to the eye, has the action of reducing elevated, as well as normal, intraocular pressure, whether or not accompanied by glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous visual field loss and optic nerve damage. Metipranolol reduces intraocular pressure with little or no effect on pupil size or accommodation in contrast to the miosis which cholinergic agents are known to produce. Mechanism of action: Although it is known that metipranolol binds the beta1 and beta2 adrenergic receptors, the mechanism of metipranolol's action is not known. It has no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and has only weak local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) and myocardial depressant activity. It appears that the ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents reduce aqueous humor production, as demonstrated by tonography and fluorophotometry. A slight increase in aqueous humor outflow may be an additional mechanism. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Adrenergic beta-Antagonists. Anti-Arrhythmia Agents.
