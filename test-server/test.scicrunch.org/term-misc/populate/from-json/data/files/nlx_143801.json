{"Optic tract of WHS11":{"AtlasImage":"Optic tract of WHS11.png,","EditorialNote":"Still needs defining criteria to be added.  Note that the current hierarchy within MBAT lists it as a type of cranial nerve\/sensory nerve.  According to the CUMBO definitions of nerve, this is not correct.  Most hierarchies include it as part of the diencephalon, so I've put it there.  Currently does not delineate the optic tract all the way into the diencephalon.","PartiallyOverlapsWith":"Optic tract","CurationStatus":"graph position temporary","SuperCategory":"Waxholm 2011 parcellation scheme region","Curator":["Maryann Martone"],"Id":"nlx_143801","ParcellationScheme":"Waxholm 2011 parcellation scheme","Is part of":"Diencephalon of WHS11","Species":"Mouse","Definition":"TBA"}}
