{"Temporal region":{"Comment":["Comment: An instance of temporal region (span:TemporalRegion) is a part of time. All parts of time are temporal region (span:TemporalRegion) entities and only temporal region (span:TemporalRegion) entities are parts of time. Time is the entire extent of the temporal universe","a designated individual","which is thus a temporal region itself.","Comment: All instances of occurrent (span:Occurrent) are temporal entities","that is","they enter in the relation of (temporal) location with temporal region (span:TemporalRegion) entities. As a particular case","the exact spatiotemporal location of a temporal region (span:TemporalRegion) is this region itself. Continuant (snap:Continuant) entities are not temporal entities in the technical sense just explained; they are related to time in a different way","not through temporal location but through a relation of existence at a time or during a period of time (see continuant (snap:Continuant).","Examples: the time it takes to run a marathon","the duration of a surgical procedure","the moment of death","Definition: An occurrent (span:Occurrent) that is part of time."],"SuperCategory":"Occurrent","Id":"TemporalRegion"}}
