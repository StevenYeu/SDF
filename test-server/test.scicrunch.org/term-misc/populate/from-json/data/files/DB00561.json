(From Martindale, The Extra Pharmocopoeia, 30th ed, p1225) Pharmacology: Doxapram is an analeptic agent (a stimulant of the central nervous system). The respiratory stimulant action is manifested by an increase in tidal volume associated with a slight increase in respiratory rate. A pressor response may result following doxapram administration. Provided there is no impairment of cardiac function, the pressor effect is more marked in hypovolemic than in normovolemic states. The pressor response is due to the improved cardiac output rather than peripheral vasoconstriction. Following doxapram administration, an increased release of catecholamines has been noted. Mechanism of action: Doxapram produces respiratory stimulation mediated through the peripheral carotid chemoreceptors. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Central Nervous System Stimulants. Respiratory System Agents"}}
