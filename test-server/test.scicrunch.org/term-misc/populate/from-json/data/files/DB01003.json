It is used in the prophylactic treatment of both allergic and exercise-induced asthma, but does not affect an established asthmatic attack. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Cromoglicate or cromolyn (USAN), a synthetic compound, inhibits antigen-induced bronchospasms and, hence, is used to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis. Cromoglicate is used as an ophthalmic solution to treat conjunctivitis and is taken orally to treat systemic mastocytosis and ulcerative colitis. Mechanism of action: Cromoglicate inhibits degranulation of mast cells, subsequently preventing the release of histamine and slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), mediators of type I allergic reactions. Cromoglicate also may reduce the release of inflammatory leukotrienes. Cromoglicate may act by inhibiting calcium influx. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Asthmatic Agents"}}
