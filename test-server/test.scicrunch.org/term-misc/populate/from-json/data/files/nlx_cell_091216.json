Andersen et al. \"The Hippocampus Book\" 2007","Definition":"OLM cells (oriens\/lacunosum-moleculare associated cell) has as its defining feature a dense axonal arbor that is confined to the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (also known as cells terminating in conjunction with entorhinal afferents). In principle the cell body and dendritic trees are located in the zones occupied by recurrent pyramidal cell collaterals. In CA3 this includes all strata except the stratum oriens."}}
