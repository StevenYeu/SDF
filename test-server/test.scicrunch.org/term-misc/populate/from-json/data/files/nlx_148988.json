It fasciculates posteriorly with the abdominal nerve trunk and it branches to innervate the testicular ducts, the seminal vesicle, the accessory glands and the anterior ejaculatory duct (Lee et al., 2001). The cell bodies of these neurons are arranged as a cluster of 8 cells at the dorsal tip of the thoracico-abdominal ganglion (Lee and Hall, 2001)."}}
