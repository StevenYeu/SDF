Cyclobenzaprine acts on the locus coeruleus where it results in increased norepinephrine release, potentially through the gamma fibers which innervate and inhibit the alpha motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. It is structurally similar to Amitriptyline, differing by only one double bond. Pharmacology: Cyclobenzaprine, closely related to the antidepressant amitriptyline, is used as a skeletal muscle relaxant to reduce pain and tenderness and improve mobility. Unlike dantrolene, cyclobenzaprine cannot be used to treat muscle spasm secondary to cerebral or spinal cord disease. Mechanism of action: Like other tricyclic antidepressants, cyclobenzaprine exhibits anticholinergic activity, potentiation of norepinephrine, and antagonism of reserpine. Cyclobenzaprine does not directly act on the neuromuscular junction or the muscle but relieves muscle spasms through a central action, possibly at the brain stem level. Cyclobenzaprine binds to the serotonin receptor and is considered a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist that reduces muscle tone by decreasing the activity of descending serotonergic neurons.
