Like the pyramidal (fusiform) cells, a principal neuron of the DCN.  Their dendrites, branching sparsely across isofrequency bands, are smooth until they reach the molecular layer, where the tips are spiny.  The axons join pyramidal cell axons to form the DAS (dorsal acoustic stria) through which they project to the contralateral inferior colliculus."}}
