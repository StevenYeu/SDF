Produced by CHO cells, mW is 91.4 kD. Pharmacology: Interferes with lymphocyte activation by specifically binding to the lymphocyte antigen, CD2, and inhibiting LFA-3\/CD2 interaction. Activation of T lymphocytes involving the interaction between LFA-3 on antigen-presenting cells and CD2 on T lymphocytes plays a role in the pathophysiology of chronic plaque psoriasis. Also causes a reduction in subsets of CD2+ T lymphocytes as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Mechanism of action: Inhibits T-lymphocyte activation and production by binding to the CD2 lymphocyte antigen. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Immunomodulatory Agents. Immunosuppressive Agents"}}
