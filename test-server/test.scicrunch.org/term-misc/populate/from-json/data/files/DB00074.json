It is a 144 kDa glycoprotein obtained from fermentation of an established mouse myeloma cell line genetically engineered to express plasmids containing the human heavy and light chain constant region genes and mouse heavy and light chain variable region genes encoding the RFT5 antibody that binds selectively to the IL-2R alpha. Pharmacology: Simulect functions as an IL-2 receptor antagonist. Specifically it inhibits IL-2-mediated activation of lymphocytes, a critical pathway in the cellular immune response involved in allograft rejection. Mechanism of action: Simulect binds with high-affinity to the Tac subunit of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor complex and inhibits IL-2 binding. The IL-2 receptor (Tac) subunit is expressed on activated but not resting lymphocytes. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Immunomodulatory Agents. Immunosuppressive Agents"}}
