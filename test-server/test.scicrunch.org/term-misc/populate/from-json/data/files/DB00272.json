(PubChem) Pharmacology: Betazole is a histamine H2 agonist used in a test for measuring maximal production of gastric acidity or anacidity. This measurement can be used to diagnose diseases such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, whereby the volume of gastric and basal secretions is measured following betazole administration (greater than 60% of the maximal acid secretion following betazole stimulation). In another test, gastritis can be diagnosed given late absence of gastric acid which is unresponsive to betazole stimulation. Betazole can be used as a gastric secretory stimulant instead of histamine with the advantage of not provoking side effects and thus not requiring the use of antihistaminic compounds. Mechanism of action: Betazole is a histamine analogue. It produces the same effects as histamine, binding the H2 receptor which is a mediator of gastric acid secretion. This agonist action thereby results in an increase in the volume of gastric acid produced. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Diagnostic Agents. Gastrointestinal Agents.
