It suppresses the paroxysmal three cycle per second spike and wave EEG pattern associated with lapses of consciousness in petit mal seizures. The frequency of attacks is reduced by depression of nerve transmission in the motor cortex. Pharmacology: Phensuximide suppresses the paroxysmal three cycle per second spike and wave EEG pattern associated with lapses of consciousness in absence (petit mal) seizures. The frequency of attacks is reduced by depression of nerve transmission in the motor cortex. Mechanism of action: Phensuximide's mechanism of action not understood, but may act in inhibitory neuronal systems that are important in the generation of the three per second rhythm Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anticonvulsants. Antiepileptic Agents"}}
