The cell body fiber projects to and arborizes with the pedunculus where it bifurcates, with one branch turning posteriorly to terminate in the calyx. The other branch projects anteriorly through the pedunculus, turns medially and runs below the medial lobe. The fiber then turns dorsally, enters the medial lobe and bifurcates in the gamma lobe. One of these fibers turns medially to the opposite medial lobe, whilst the other turns dorsolaterally and terminates in the inferior neuropils, posterior to the medial lobe."}}
