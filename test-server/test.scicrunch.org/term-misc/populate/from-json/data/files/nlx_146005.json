The electrical current induced in the brain by this magnetic field then stimulates neurons to activate or inhibit them. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used as a non-invasive means of mapping localized functions within the brain, suppression of epileptic seizures, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)has been used as a treatment for depression."}}
