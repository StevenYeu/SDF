The 22 tests in CANTAB examine various areas of cognitive function, including:  * general memory and learning, * working memory and executive function, * visual memory, * attention and reaction time (RT), * semantic-verbal memory, * decision making and response control.  The CANTAB endeavours to import the accuracy and rigour of computerised psychological testing whilst retaining the wide range of ability measures demanded of a neuropsychological battery. It is suitable for young and old subjects, and aims to be culture and language independent through the use of non-verbal stimuli in the majority of the tests."}}
