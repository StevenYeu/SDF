(PubChem) Pharmacology: Enoxacin is a quinolone\/fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Enoxacin is bactericidal and its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Enoxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Enoxacin may be active against pathogens resistant to drugs that act by different mechanisms. Mechanism of action: Enoxacin exerts its bactericidal action via the inhibition of the essential bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase (DNA Topoisomerase II). Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Infective Agents. Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors"}}
