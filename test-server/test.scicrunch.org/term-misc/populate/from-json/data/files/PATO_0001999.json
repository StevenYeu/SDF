{"Lacks parts or has fewer parts of type":{"SuperCategory":"Has number of","Id":"PATO_0001999","Definition":"The bearer of this quality has part < n of the indicated entity type, where n is the normal amount for a comparable organism.  Note that the bearer of the quality is the whole, not the part.  Formally: if a bearer entity e has fewer parts of type X at time t, then the number of instances x of X at t such that x part of e is < n, where n is either the normal number for comparable entities, or n is stated explicitly.  This case includes the limit case, where the bearer lacks all parts of the specified type."}}
