Telbivudine is orally administered, with good tolerance, lack of toxicity and no dose-limiting side effects. Pharmacology: Telbivudine is a synthetic thymidine nucleoside analogue with activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV). Telbivudine is the unmodified L enantiomer of the naturally occurring nucleoside, thymidine. Mechanism of action: Telbivudine 5'triphosphate inhibits HBV DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) by competing with the natural substrate, thymidine 5'triphosphate. Incorporation of telbivudine 5'triphosphate into viral DNA causes DNA chain termination, resulting in inhibition of HBV replication. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antiviral Agents. Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors"}}
