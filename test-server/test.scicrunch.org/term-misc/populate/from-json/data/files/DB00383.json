Pharmacology: Oxyphencyclimine is a synthetic anticholinergic agent which has been shown in experimental and clinical studies to have a pronounced antispasmodic and antisecretory effect on the gastrointestinal tract. Oxyphencyclimine is an antimuscarinic, anticholinergic drug. Mechanism of action: Oxyphencyclimine binds the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. It may block all three types of muscarinic receptors including M-1 receptors in the CNS and ganglia, M-2 receptors in the heart (vagus) and M-3 receptors at the parasympathetic NEJ system. The muscarinic acetylcholine receptors mediate various cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase, breakdown of phosphoinositides and modulation of potassium channels through the action of G proteins. Oxphencyclimine inhibits vagally mediated reflexes by antagonizing the action of acetylcholine. This in turn reduces the secretion of gastric acids in the stomach. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anticholinergic Agents. Antispasmodics"}}
