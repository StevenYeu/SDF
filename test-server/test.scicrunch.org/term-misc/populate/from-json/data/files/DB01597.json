Since the antibiotic, imipenem, is hydrolyzed by dehydropeptidase-I, which resides in the brush border of the renal tubule, cilastatin is administered with imipenem to increase its effectiveness. The drug also inhibits the metabolism of leukotriene D4 to leukotriene E4. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Cilastatin is a chemical compound which inhibits the human enzyme dehydropeptidase. Dehydropeptidase is found in the kidney and is responsible for degrading the antibiotic imipenem. Cilastatin is therefore combined intravenously with imipenem in order to protect it from dehydropeptidase and prolong its antibacterial effect. However, cilastatin in and of itself does not have any antibacterial activity. Mechanism of action: Cilastatin is a renal dehydropeptidase-I and leukotriene D4 dipeptidase inhibitor. Since the antibiotic, imipenem, is hydrolyzed by dehydropeptidase-I, which resides in the brush border of the renal tubule, cilastatin is administered with imipenem to increase its effectiveness. The drug also inhibits the metabolism of leukotriene D4 to leukotriene E4. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Protease Inhibitors"}}
