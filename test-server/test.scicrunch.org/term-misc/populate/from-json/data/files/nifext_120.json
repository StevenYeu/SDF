The cell bodies are arranged in a thin layer between the granule cell layer and the external plexiform layer.  Each mitral cell is usually characterized in the mammal by a single primary dendrite that traverses the external plexiform layer and terminates within an olfactory glomerulus in a tuft of branches which receives input from the axons of olfactory receptor neurons.  Axons of the mitral cells project to a number of areas in the brain, including the piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, olfactory tubercle, and amygdala."}}
