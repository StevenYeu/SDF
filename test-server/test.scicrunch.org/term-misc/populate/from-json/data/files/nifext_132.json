Unipolar brush cells are found in primarily in the granular cell layer and most concentrated in lobule IX, the flocculus, the nodulus and the ventromedial zone of the paraflocculus.  Their somata are larger than granule cells but smaller than Golgi cells.  They are known to stain for calretinin."}}
