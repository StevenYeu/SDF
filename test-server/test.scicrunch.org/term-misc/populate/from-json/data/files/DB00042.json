The protein exists in noncovalent association with hemagglutinin and nonhemagglutinin proteins as a neurotoxin complex. The neurotoxin complex is recovered from the fermentation process and purified through a series of precipitation and chromatography steps. Pharmacology: Botulinum Toxin Type B inhibits acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction via a three stage process: 1) Heavy Chain mediated neurospecific binding of the toxin, 2) internalization of the toxin by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and 3) ATP and pH dependent translocation of the Light Chain to the neuronal cytosol where it acts as a zinc-dependent endoprotease cleaving polypeptides essential for neurotransmitter release. Mechanism of action: Botulinum Toxin Type B binds to and cleaves the synaptic Vesicle Associated Membrane Protein (VAMP, also known as synaptobrevin) which is a component of the protein complex responsible for docking and fusion of the synaptic vesicle to the presynaptic membrane, a necessary step to neurotransmitter release. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Antidystonic Agents"}}
