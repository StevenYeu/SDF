Pharmacology: Doxacurium chloride is a long-acting, nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant. The neuromuscular block produced by doxacurium chloride may be antagonized by anticholinesterase agents. As with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, the more profound the neuromuscular block at reversal, the longer the time and the greater the dose of anticholinesterase required for recovery of neuromuscular function. Doxacurium chloride is approximately 2.5 to 3 times more potent than pancuronium and 10 to 12 times more potent than metocurine. Mechanism of action: Doxacurium chloride binds competitively to cholinergic receptors on the motor end-plate to antagonize the action of acetylcholine, resulting in a block of neuromuscular transmission. This action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Neuromuscular Nondepolarizing Agents"}}
