(PubChem) Pharmacology: Cyclopentolate is an anti-muscarinic in the same class as atropine and scopolamine. Cyclopentolate blocks the receptors in the muscles of the eye (muscarinic receptors). These receptors are involved controlling the pupil size and the shape of the lens. Cyclopentolate thus induces relaxation of the sphincter of the iris and the ciliary muscles. When applied topically to the eyes, it causes a rapid, intense cycloplegic and mydriatic effect that is maximal in 15 to 60 minutes; recovery usually occurs within 24 hours. The cycloplegic and mydriatic effects are slower in onset and longer in duration in patients who have dark pigmented irises. Mechanism of action: By blocking muscarinic receptors, cyclopentolate produces dilatation of the pupil (mydriasis) and prevents the eye from accommodating for near vision (cycloplegia). Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antimuscarinic eye preparations. Muscarinic Antagonists. Mydriatics. Parasympatholytics"}}
