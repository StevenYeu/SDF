It is an irreversible inhibitor of 4-aminobutyrate transaminase, the enzyme responsible for the catabolism of gamma-aminobutyric acid. (From Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 31st ed) Pharmacology: Vigabatrin, is an anticonvulsant chemically unrelated to other anticonvulsants. Vigabatrin inhibits the catabolism of GABA. It is an analog of GABA, but it is not a receptor agonist. Mechanism of action: It is believed that vigabatrin increases brain concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, by irreversibly inhibiting enzymes that catabolize GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase GABA-T) or block the reuptake of GABA into glia and nerve endings. Vigabatrin may also work by suppressing repetitive neuronal firing through inhibition of voltage-sensitive sodium channels. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anticonvulsants. Enzyme Inhibitors. GABA Agents"}}
