This protein, a homotetramer, is present in most cells (except erythrocytes) and catalyzes the hydrolysis of acylcholines to yield a choline and a carboxylate anion. Reduced serum activity of the BCHE protein causes hypocholinesterasemia, a condition resulting in sensitivity to the muscle relaxant suxamethonium, which is commonly used in association with surgical anesthesia.
