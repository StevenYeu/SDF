{"Doublecortin":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Protein","Id":"nlx_mol_20090513","Has role":["Microtubule Associated Protein"],"Definition":"A cytoplasmic protein which appears to direct neuronal migration by regulating the organization and stability of microtubules. The encoded protein contains two doublecortin domains, which bind microtubules. In addition, the encoded protein interacts with LIS1, the regulatory gamma subunit of platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase, and this interaction is important to proper microtubule function in the developing cortex (Entrez Gene definition:  GeneID: 1641."}}
