There is preliminary evidence that it has a similar safety profile to caspofungin. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Anidulafungin is a semi-synthetic lipopeptide synthesized from a fermentation product of Aspergillus nidulans. Anidulafungin is an echinocandin, a class of antifungal drugs that inhibits the synthesis of 1,3--D-glucan, an essential component of fungal cell walls. Anidulafungin is active in vitro against Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis. Mechanism of action: Anidulafungin is a semi-synthetic echinocandin with antifungal activity. Anidulafungin inhibits glucan synthase, an enzyme present in fungal, but not mammalian cells. This results in inhibition of the formation of 1,3--D-glucan, an essential component of the fungal cell wall. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antibiotics, Antifungal"}}
