The L-M interneurons have been described as non-fast spiking cells (Kawaguchi and Hama, 1987) with membrane properties very different from those of pyramidal cells (Williams and Lacaille, 1993). Dendrites extend in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare, radiatum, and oriens and have a very wide extension in the transverse slice (Lacaille and Schwartzkroin, 1988a). The axonal arborization seems to cover a wide area in both transverse and longitudianal directions, projecting in stratum pyramidale and sometimes in the stratum oriens (Lacaille and Schwartzkroin, 1988a)."}}
