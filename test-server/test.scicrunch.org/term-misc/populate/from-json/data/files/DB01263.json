Pharmacology: Posaconazole is a triazole antifungal drug that is used to treat invasive infections by Candida species and Aspergillus species in severely immunocompromised patients. There is also limited clinical evidence for its utility in treatment of invasive disease caused by Fusarium species (fusariosis). Two studies published in the January 25, 2007 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine suggest posaconazole may be superior to other triazoles, such as fluconazole or itraconazole, in the prevention of invasive fungal infections, although it may cause more serious side effects. Mechanism of action: As a triazole antifungal agent, posaconazole blocks the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of the enzyme lanosterol 14-demethylase and accumulation of methylated sterol precursors. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antibiotics, Antifungal. Trypanocidal Agents"}}
