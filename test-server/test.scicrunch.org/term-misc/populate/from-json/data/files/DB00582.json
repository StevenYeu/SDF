It is used to treat invasive fungal infections that are generally seen in patients who are immunocompromised. These include invasive candidiasis, invasive aspergillosis, and emerging fungal infections. Pharmacology: Voriconazole is a triazole antifungal agent indicated for use in the treatment of fungal infections including invasive aspergillosis, esophageal candidiasis, and serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium apiospermum (asexual form of Pseudallescheria boydii) and Fusarium spp. including Fusarium solani. Fungal plasma membranes are similar to mammalian plasma membranes, differing in having the nonpolar sterol ergosterol, rather than cholesterol, as the principal sterol. Membrane sterols such as ergosterol provide structure, modulation of membrane fluidity, and possibly control of some physiologic events. Voriconazole effects the formation of the fungal plasma membrane by indirectly inhibiting the biosynthesis of ergosterol. This results in plasma membrane permeability changes and inhibition of growth. Mechanism of action: Voriconazole binds and inhibits ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting CYP450-dependent 14-alpha sterol demethylase. The inhibition of 14-alpha sterol demethylase results in a depletion of ergosterol in fungal cell membrane. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antifungal Agents.
