This mutation alters the secondary shift of residue 53 from a positive to a negative value and thereby creates a short contiguous region of negative shifts around the site of the mutation, indicating a local preference for extended backbone configurations.  This mutation accelerates alpha-synuclein oligomerization, increases the rate of mature fibril formations, and aggregates much faster than wild type alpha-synuclein.  It has an earlier onset.  Flies expressing A53T alpha-synuclein show symptoms of Parkinson's disease and are used in the lab to study the disease."}}
