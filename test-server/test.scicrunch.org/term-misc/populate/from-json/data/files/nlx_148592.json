The cell body fiber bifurcates near the vertical lobe. One of these fibers turns ventromedially to the tip of the medial lobe, whereas the other runs dorsally. The ventromedially directed branch innervates the medial lobe through the border between the gamma and beta' lobes. One branch runs medially to the opposite medial lobe whereas the other runs laterally to the basal segments of the alpha lobe and the inner core of the pedunculus. From the alpha lobe, one branch runs dorsally, turns dorsolaterally behind the alpha lobe and terminates in the posterior of the superior neuropils where it arborizes and further spreads laterally to the anterior dorsal superior lateral protocerebrum and the inferior neuropils."}}
