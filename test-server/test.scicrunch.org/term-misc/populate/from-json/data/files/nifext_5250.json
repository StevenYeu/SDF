{"NMDA-type glutamate-gated cationic channel":{"Created":"2007-09-19","Synonym":["NMDA receptor","NMDA"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Glutamate-gated cationic channel","Id":"nifext_5250","Has role":["Neurotransmitter Receptor","Glutamate receptor"],"Definition":"Tetrameric receptor, consisting of two glycine binding NR1 subunits and two glutamate binding NR2 subunits.  The glycine-binding NR3 subunits can also assemble with NR2 subunits.  NR1 and NR3 subunits assemble only in xenopus oocytes to form a glycine gated receptor.  NMDA receptors bind glutamate, aspartate, NMDA, NMDA receptors' conductance is modified by glycine, Magnesium, Zinc and 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV)Laube et al., suggest that the recombinant NMDA receptor is a tetramer (PMID: 9526012, also see PMID: 18779583)."}}
