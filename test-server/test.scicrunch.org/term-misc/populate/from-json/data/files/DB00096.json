Pharmacology: Regulates the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood. It is used to increase the circulating plasma volume, thereby reducing hemoconcentration and blood viscosity. Also used as a transport protein that binds naturally occurring, therapeutic and toxic materials in circulation. Mechanism of action: Serum albumin acts as a high molecular weight, very soluble osmolyte Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Serum substitutes"}}
