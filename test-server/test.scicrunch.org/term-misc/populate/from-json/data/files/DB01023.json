It lowers blood pressure by reducing peripheral vascular resistance through a highly selective action on smooth muscle in arteriolar resistance vessels. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Felodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, is used alone or with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, to treat hypertension, chronic stable angina pectoris, and Prinzmetal's variant angina. Felodipine is similar to other peripheral vasodilators. Felodipine inhibits the influx of extra cellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes blocking the calcium channels. The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload. Mechanism of action: Felodipine is a calcium channel blocker. It reversibly competes with nitrendipine and\/or other calcium channel blockers for dihydropyridine binding sites, blocks voltage-dependent calcium currents in vascular smooth muscle and cultured rabbit atrial cells, and blocks potassium-induced contracture of the rat portal vein. By blocking the calcium channels, felodipine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes and results in a decrease of peripheral vascular resistance.
