Its axon arises from the deeper aspect of the cell body and gives rise to collaterals which terminate within the layer III on local intrinsic cells, and also recur to layer III and II where they form association fibers that connect to the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons and continue to become centrifugal fibers to the olfactory bulb."}}
