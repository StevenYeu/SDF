This medicine acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce the number and severity of seizures. Pharmacology: Phenacemide is a ureal anticonvulsant indicated for control of severe epilepsy, particularly mixed forms of complex partial (psychomotor or temporal lobe) seizures, refractory to other anticonvulsants. Phenacemide elevates the threshold for minimal electroshock convulsions and abolishes the tonic phase of maximal electroshock seizures. It also prevents or modifies seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol or other convulsants. Mechanism of action: Phenacemide binds to and blocks neuronal sodium channels or voltage sensitive calcium channels. This blocks or suppresses neuronal depolarization and hypersynchronization. Hypersynchronization is what often causes seizures. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anticonvulsants"}}
