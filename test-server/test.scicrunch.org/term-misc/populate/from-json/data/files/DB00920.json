It has been proposed for the treatment of asthma, rhinitis, skin allergies, and anaphylaxis. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Ketotifen is a fast acting non-competitive histamine antagonist. It inhibits the release of mediators from mast cells. It is a non-bronchodilator antiasthmatic drug (when taken orally). Mechanism of action: Ketotifen is a relatively selective, non-competitive histamine antagonist (H1-receptor) and mast cell stabilizer. Ketotifen inhibits the release of mediators from mast cells involved in hypersensitivity reactions. Decreased chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils has also been demonstrated. Ketotifen also inhibits cAMP phosphodiesterase. Properties of ketotifen which may contribute to its antiallergic activity and its ability to affect the underlying pathology of asthma include inhibition of the development of airway hyper-reactivity associated with activation of platelets by PAF (Platelet Activating Factor), inhibition of PAF-induced accumulation of eosinophils and platelets in the airways, suppression of the priming of eosinophils by human recombinant cytokines and antagonism of bronchoconstriction due to leukotrienes. Ketotifen inhibits of the release of allergic mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes C4 and D4(SRS-A) and PAF. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Allergic Agents. Antipruritics. Histamine H1 Antagonists"}}
