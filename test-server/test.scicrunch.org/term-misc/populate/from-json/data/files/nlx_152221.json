{"Neuronal nuclear antigen":{"Synonym":["Feminizing Locus on X-3","Fox-3"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Protein","Id":"nlx_152221","Has role":"Neuron specific marker","Abbrev":["NeuN"],"Definition":"A 46\/48KD DNA-binding, neuron-specific protein found in nuclei which is present in most vertebrate CNS and PNS neuronal cell types.  NeuN is widely used to label neurons, despite some shortcomings.  A few neuronal cell types are not recognized by the NeuN antibody, such as cerebellar Purkinje cells and Golgi cells, olfactory Mitral cells and retinal photoreceptors. However the vast majority of neurons are strongly NeuN positive. NeuN immunoreactivity becomes obvious as neurons mature, typically after they have downregulated expression of Doublecortin, a marker seen in the earliest stages of neuronal development.
