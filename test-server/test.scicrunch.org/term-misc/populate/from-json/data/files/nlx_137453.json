{"Neural circuit":{"RelatedTo":"Neuroscience","Synonym":["Neural network","Neuronal signaling"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Computational model","Id":"nlx_137453","Has role":"Electrophysiology concept","Definition":"neural network describes a population of physically interconnected neurons or a group of disparate neurons whose inputs or signalling targets define a recognizable circuit. Communication between neurons often involves an electrochemical process. The interface through which they interact with surrounding neurons usually consists of several dendrites (input connections), which are connected via synapses to other neurons, and one axon (output connection). If the sum of the input signals surpasses a certain threshold, the neuron sends an action potential (AP) at the axon hillock and transmits this electrical signal along the axon.In contrast, a neuronal circuit is a functional entity of interconnected neurons that influence each other (similar to a control loop in cybernetics). - definition adapted from Wikipedia"}}
