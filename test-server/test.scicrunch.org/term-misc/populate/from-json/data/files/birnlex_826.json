{"Basal ganglia":{"Created":"2006-10-10","EditorialNote":"Note that the term basal ganglia is also used to refer to subcortical nuclei of telencephalic origin. We have listed this definition under \"Basal nuclear complex\" and listed basal ganglia as a synonym.From the BAMS Thesaurus:Synonym for cerebral nuclei (Swanson, 2000); see Warwick & Williams (1973, p. 805; and Williams & Warwick, 1980, p. 864). Its use is discouraged because reference to ganglia (Galen, c173) in the cerebrospinal axis (Meckel, 1817) is archaic; and because \"basal ganglia\" today usually refers to a functional system that includes components in the forebrain (Goette, 1873) and midbrain (Baer, 1837), rather than to a topographic division of the endbrain (Kuhlenbeck, 1927); see Anthoney (1994, pp. 106-109), DeLong & Wichmann (2007), and Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology (1998, *A14.1.09.501).","CurationStatus":"pending final vetting","Comment":["This class should be a defined class through the part of relationship.

The nuclei usually included are the caudate nucleus (caudoputamen in rodents), putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra (pars compacta and pars reticulata) and the subthalamic nucleus.  Some also include the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum."}}
