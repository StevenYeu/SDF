Neurons in NL and MSO are structurally and biophysically specialized to compute interaural time differences (ITDs), time disparities in the arrival of signals between the two ears, using low-frequency sounds. ITDs are the primary binaural cues for sound localization and segregation in humans and other low-frequency hearing vertebrates. While commonly used laboratory mammals such as mice and rats are high-frequency listeners and have a poorly developed MSO circuit, the structurally and functionally similar circuit in the chicken brainstem provides a particularly useful vertebrate model for basic research of ITD computation, due to its simple anatomy, well-characterized development and cell biology, and importantly, as a genetic tractable system."}}
