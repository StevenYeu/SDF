{"Benzedrine":{"Synonym":"bennies","CurationStatus":"uncurated","Id":"nlx_chem_100304","Has role":["Drug of abuse role","Central nervous system stimulant","Drug"],"Definition":"The trade name of the racemic mixture of amphetamine (dl-amphetamine) and marketed in the form of inhalers. Benzedrine was used to enlarge nasal and bronchial passages and it is closely related to other stimulants, such as dextroamphetamine (d-amphetamine) and methamphetamine. While the drug was initially used for medical purposes, as a bronchodilator, early users of the Benzedrine inhaler discovered that it had a euphoric stimulant effect, resulting in it being one of the earliest synthetic stimulants to be widely used for recreational (i.e., non-medical) purposes.(Adapted from Wikipedia)"}}
