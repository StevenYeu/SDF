This receptor is directly associated with one of its ultimate effectors, the class C L-type calcium channel Ca(V)1.2. This receptor-channel complex also contains a G protein, an adenylyl cyclase, cAMP-dependent kinase, and the counterbalancing phosphatase, PP2A. The assembly of the signaling complex provides a mechanism that ensures specific and rapid signaling by this G protein-coupled receptor. This receptor's gene is intronless. Different polymorphic forms, point mutations, and\/or downregulation of this gene are associated with nocturnal asthma, obesity and type 2 diabetes. (adapted from Entrez gene)"}}
