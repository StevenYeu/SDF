More specifically it is a purified murine (mouse) monoclonal antibody, directed against the CD3 (T3) receptor on the surface of human T-cells (T-lymphocytes) cultured using the murine ascites method. Muromonab is 93% monomeric immune globulin G type 2a (IgG2a). Pharmacology: Used in organ transplant prophylaxis, Muromonab or OKT-3 binds specifically to the CD-3 complex, which is involved in antigen recognition and cell stimulation, on the surface of T lymphocytes. Immediately after administration CD-3-positive T lymphocytes are abruptly removed from circulation. It has been effective in reversing corticosteroid-resistant acute rejection in renal, liver, and cardiac transplant recipients. Mechanism of action: Muromonab binds to the T-cell surface glycoprotein CD3 epsilon chain. It appears to kill CD-3 positive cells by inducing Fc mediated apoptosis, antibody mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Immunomodulatory Agents. Immunosuppressive Agents"}}
