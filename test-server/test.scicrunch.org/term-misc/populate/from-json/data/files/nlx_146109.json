The patient is then presented with a series of word pairs, and the task is to identify which of the two words came from the target list. A series of 50 faces is then presented at the same rate, and the patient is asked to provide the same pleasant versus unpleasant judgments; the patient is then presented with a series of 50 pairs of faces, and the task is again to identify which of the two faces came from the target list.and#34; - (Hermann, Connell, Barr, andamp; Wyler 1995)"}}
