It has been shown in some cases to be more potent than diazepam or nitrazepam. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Estazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine derivative, is an oral hypnotic agent with anticonvulsant, hypnotic, and muscle relaxant properties. It has been shown in some cases to be more potent than diazepam or nitrazepam. Mechanism of action: Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to benzodiazepine receptors, which affects affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors, this enhances the effects GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell. Drug type: Approved. Illicit. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-anxiety Agents. Anticonvulsants. GABA Modulators"}}
