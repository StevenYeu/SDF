{"Remifentanil":{"RelatedTo":"Mu-type opioid receptor","Synonym":["Remifentanyl"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB00899","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB00899","Definition":"Remifentanil (marketed by Abbott as Ultiva) is a potent ultra short-acting synthetic opioid analgesic drug. It is given to patients during surgery to relieve pain and as an adjunct to an anaesthetic. Remifentanil is a specific  -opioid receptor agonist. Hence, it causes a reduction in sympathetic nervous system tone, respiratory depression and analgesia. Pharmacology: Remifentanil is an opioid agonist with rapid onset and peak effect and ultra-short duration of action. The opioid activity of remifentanil is antagonized by opioid antagonists such as naloxone. The analgesic effects of remifentanil are rapid in onset and offset. Its effects and side effects are dose dependent and similar to other opioids. Remifentanil in humans has a rapid blood-brain equilibration half-time of 1  1 minutes (mean  SD) and a rapid onset of action. Mechanism of action: Remifentanil is a -opioid agonist with rapid onset and peak effect, and short duration of action. The -opioid activity of remifentanil is antagonized by opioid antagonists such as naloxone. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Analgesics, Opioid. Anesthetics, Intravenous. Hypnotics and Sedatives"}}
