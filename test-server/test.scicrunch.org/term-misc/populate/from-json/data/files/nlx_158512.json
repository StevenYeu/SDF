{"Intebrain":{"Synonym":"Diencephalon","DefiningCriteria":"topography","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Regional part of brain","Id":"nlx_158512","Is part of":"Cerebrospinal axis","Definition":"The caudal and ventral topographic division of the forebrain. The interbrain in turn has two great topographic divisions, dorsally the thalamus and ventrally the hypothalamus. This basic division of the macrodissected adult human brain( has been recognized at least since Varolio (1573, p. 13, his \"pars posterior medullae spinalis\"), and it received its current name for vertebrates from Baer (1837, p. 107; in the original German, \"Zwischenhirn\"). This English form of diencephalon (Sharpey et al., 1867) has been used routinely, for example by Sharpey et al. (1867, p. 577), Johnston (1906, p. 25), Strong & Elwyn (1943, p. 12), and Williams & Warwick (1980, p. 953)."}}
