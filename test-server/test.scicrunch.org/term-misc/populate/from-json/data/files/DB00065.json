It is composed of human constant and murine variable regions. Infliximab is produced by a recombinant cell line cultured by continuous perfusion Pharmacology: Used in the treatment of auto-immune disorders such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Infliximab binds to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) and inhibits binding of TNFa with its receptors. This reduces production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins (IL) 1 and 6. This also limits leukocyte migration and expression of adhesion molecules by endothelial cells and leukocytes. Infliximab also limits the activation of neutrophil and eosinophil functional activity, reduces production of tissue degrading enzymes produced by synoviocytes and\/or chondrocytes. Infliximab decreases synovitis and joint erosions in collagen-induced arthritis and allows eroded joints to heal. Mechanism of action: Infliximab neutralizes the biological activity of TNFa by binding with high affinity to the soluble and transmembrane forms of TNFa and inhibits binding of TNFa with its receptors. Infliximab does not neutralize TNFb (lymphotoxin a), a related cytokine that utilizes the same receptors as TNFa Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Immunomodulatory Agents. Immunosuppressive Agents"}}
