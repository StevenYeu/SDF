{"Pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Scientific_discipline","Id":"nlx_inv_100662","Definition":"From BRO: (in Greek: \"pharmacon\" meaning drug and \"kinetikos\" meaning putting in motion, the study of time dependency; sometimes abbreviated as \"PK\") is a branch of pharmacology dedicated to the determination of the fate of substances administered externally to a living organism. In practice, this discipline is applied mainly to drug substances, though in principle it concerns itself with all manner of compounds ingested or otherwise delivered externally to an organism, such as nutrients, metabolites, hormones, toxins, etc.Pharmacokinetics is often studied in conjunction with pharmacodynamics. Pharmacodynamics explores what a drug does to the body, whereas pharmacokinetics explores what the body does to the drug. Pharmacokinetics includes the study of the mechanisms of absorption and distribution of an administered drug, the rate at which a drug action begins and the duration of the effect, the chemical changes of the substance in the body (e.g. by enzymes) and the effects and routes of excretion of the metabolites of the drug. - definition adapted from Wikipedia"}}
