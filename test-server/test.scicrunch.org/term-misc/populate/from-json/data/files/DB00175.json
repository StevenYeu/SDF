It acts as a competitive inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase (hydroxymethylglutaryl COA reductases). (PubChem) Pharmacology: Pravastatin, an antilipemic agent, is used to treat primary hypercholesterolemia. Unlike lovastatin and simvastatin, pravastatin is relatively hydrophilic and does not require hydrolysis for activation. Mechanism of action: Like lovastatin and simvastatin, pravastatin inhibits hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. As HMG-CoA is necessary for the intracellular synthesis of cholesterol, its inhibition results in increased clearance of circulating LDL. Pravastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of VLDL, the precursor for LDL, reducing circulating cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anticholesteremic Agents. HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors. Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors"}}
