(PubChem) Pharmacology: Methazolamide is topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Methazolamide is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who are insufficiently responsive to beta-blockers. Methazolamide is a sulfonamide derivative; however, it does not have any clinically significant antimicrobial properties. Although methazolamide achieves a high concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, it is not-considered an effective anticonvulsant. Methazolamide has a weak and transient diuretic effect, therefore use results in an increase in urinary volume, with excretion of sodium, potassium and chloride. Mechanism of action: Methazolamide is a potent inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion, presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors. Diuretics"}}
