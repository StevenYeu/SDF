Although only a small number of them were labelled, they resemble the medial terminal nucleus (MTN) to projecting cells described by Dann and Buhl (1987). Compared with neurons in Group RGA, RGC1 cells have smaller cell bodies, a higher density of dendritic branching, and usually asymmetrical dendritic fields. The RGC1 cells exhibited smooth, small caliber, recursive dendrites extending from large primary ones. Dendritic field was of medium density (Fig. 6A). The RGC1 stratified mostly in the inner IPL. Their morphology is very similar to the MTN to projecting cells characterized by Dann and Buhl (1987)."}}
