It plays a role as a terminal autoreceptor that regulates the rate of serotonin release from nerve endings. This serotonin receptor subtype is closely related to and has similar drug binding properties as the 5-HT1B receptor, but is expressed at low levels. It is particularly sensitive to the agonist sumatripan and may be involved in mediating the drug's antimigrane effect."}}
