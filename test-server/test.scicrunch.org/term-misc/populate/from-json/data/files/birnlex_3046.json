The subject is instructed to rate how each statement applies to him or her within the past week.  Each item is rated on a scale from None of the time, some of the time, a good part of the time, most or all of the time. The raw score range is from 20 - 80.  This is converted to a percentage, by dividing the raw score by 80 and multiplying by 100.  Low scores or percentages indicate low levels of anxiety and high scores indicate high levels of anxiety."}}
