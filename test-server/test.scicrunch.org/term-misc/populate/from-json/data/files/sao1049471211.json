{"Interchromatin Granule":{"SuperCategory":"Nuclear Subcomponent","Id":"sao1049471211","Definition":"A class of nuclear body measuring 20-25 nm in diameter and distributed throughout the interchromatin space, linked together by thin fibrils. They are believed to be storage centers for various snRNAs, snRNPs, serine\/arginine-rich proteins and RNA polymerase II. A typical mammalian cell contains 25-50 clusters of interchromatin granules. Interchromatin granule clusters do not contain the heterogeneous nuclear RNA-binding proteins (hnRNPs) (Gene Ontology)."}}
