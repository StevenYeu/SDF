{"Photoactivated localization microscopy":{"EditorialNote":"Trying to consolidate the assay and protocol branch, as it leads to unnecessary duplication.  Decided to go with protocol","Synonym":["Photoactivated localization microscopy imaging","PALM imaging"],"CurationStatus":"graph position temporary","SuperCategory":"Optical imaging protocol","Curator":["Maryann Martone"],"Id":"nlx_158011","Has role":"Super-resolution microscopy","Abbrev":"PALM","Definition":"A light microscopic imaging assay that builds up an image from many dark fluorophores that can be photoactivated into a fluorescing state by a flash of light. Because photoactivation is stochastic, only a few, well separated molecules \"turn on.\" Then Gaussians are fit to their PSFs to high precision. After the few bright dots photobleach, another flash of the photoactivating light activates random fluorophores again and the PSFs are fit of these different well spaced objects. This process is repeated many times, building up an image molecule-by-molecule; and because the molecules were localized at different times, the \"resolution\" of the final image can be much higher than that limited by diffraction.
