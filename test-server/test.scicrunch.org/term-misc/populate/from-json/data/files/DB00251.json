(Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Terconazole is a triazole antifungal agent available for intravaginal use. It is structurally related to imidazole-derivative antifungal agents, although terconazole and other triazoles have 3 nitrogens in the azole ring. Mechanism of action: Terconazole may exert its antifungal activity by disrupting normal fungal cell membrane permeability. Terconazole and other triazole antifungal agents inhibit cytochrome P450 14-alpha-demethylase in susceptible fungi, which leads to the accumulation of lanosterol and other methylated sterols and a decrease in ergosterol concentration. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antifungal Agents. Antifungals"}}
