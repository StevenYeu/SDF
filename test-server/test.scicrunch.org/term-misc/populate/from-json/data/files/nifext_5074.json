Galanin signaling occurs through three G protein-coupled receptors.[2]The functional role of galanin remains largely unknown; however, galanin is predominately involved in the modulation and inhibition of action potentials in neurons. Galanin has been implicated in many biologically diverse functions, including: nociception, waking and sleep regulation, cognition, feeding, regulation of mood, regulation of blood pressure, it also has roles in development as well as acting as a trophic factor.[3] Galanin is linked to a number of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy as well as depression, eating disorders and cancer.[4][5] Galanin appears to have neuroprotective activity as its biosynthesis is increased 2-10 fold upon axotomy in the peripheral nervous system as well as when seizure activity occurs in the brain. It may also promote neurogenesis.[2]Galanin is predominantly an inhibitory, hyperpolarizing neuropeptide[6]and as such inhibits neurotransmitter release. Galanin is often co-localized with classical neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, and also with other neuromodulators such as Neuropeptide Y, Substance P, and Vasoactive intestinal peptide.[7][1] Evans H, Baumgartner M, Shine J, Herzog H (December 1993). \"Genomic organization and localization of the gene encoding human preprogalanin\".
