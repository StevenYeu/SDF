It is used as a vasoconstrictor, specifically for the therapy of migraine disorders. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Dihydroergotamine is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine headaches with or without aura and the acute treatment of cluster headache episodes. Dihydroergotamine binds with high affinity to 5-HT1Da and 5-HT1Db receptors. It also binds with high affinity to serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors, noradrenaline a2A, a2B and a receptors, and dopamine D2L and D3 receptors. The therapeutic activity of Dihydroergotamine in migraine is generally attributed to the agonist effect at 5-HT1D receptors. Mechanism of action: Two theories have been proposed to explain the efficacy of 5-HT1D receptor agonists in migraine: 1) activation of 5-HT1D receptors located on intracranial blood vessels, including those on arterio-venous anastomoses, leads to vasoconstriction, which correlates with the relief of migraine headache and 2) activation of 5-HT1D receptors on sensory nerve endings of the trigeminal system results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release.
