It has been marketed as an anxiolytic since 1975 and an anticonvulsant since 1984. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Clobazam is a barbiturate used in combination with acetaminophen or aspirin and caffeine for its sedative and relaxant effects in the treatment of tension headaches, migraines, and pain. Mechanism of action: Clobazam binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABA-A receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is prolonged as a result. Drug type: Approved. Illicit. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anticonvulsants. Benzodiazepines"}}
