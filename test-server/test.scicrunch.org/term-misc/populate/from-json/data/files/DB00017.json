Pharmacology: Calcitonin inhibits bone removal by osteoclasts (bone remodeling cells) and promotes bone formation by osteoblasts. This leads to a net increase in bone mass. Calcitonin also reduces plasma calcium levels and enhances secretion of ions in the kidney. Mechanism of action: Calcitonin binds to the calcitonin receptor (found primarily in osteoclasts) which then enhances the production of vitamin D producing enzymes (25-hydroxyvitamine D-24-hydroxylase), leading to greater calcium retention and enhanced bone density. Binding of calcitonin to its receptor also activates adenylyl cyclase and the phosphatidyl-inositol-calcium pathway. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Antihypocalcemic Agents. Antiosteporotic Agents. Bone Density Conservation Agents"}}
