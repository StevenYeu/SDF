In the rat retina the arrangement of the dendirtes is visualized more readily in vertical sections than in whole mounts, and the dendritic filed is found to terminate in either the inner or the outer half of the inner plexiform layer, although the latter is more common. The cells have a mean soma size of 8.9 micrometers (range 7.5 to 10.5 micrometers; N "}}
