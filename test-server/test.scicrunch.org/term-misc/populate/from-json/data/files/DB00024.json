{"Thyrotropin Alfa":{"RelatedTo":"Thyrotropin receptor","Synonym":["FSH-B","FSH-beta","Follicle-stimulating hormone beta subunit","Follitropin beta chain precursor"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB00024","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB00024","Definition":"Thyrotropin alfa is a heterodimeric glycoprotein comprised of two non-covalently linked subunits, an alpha subunit of 92 amino acid residues containing two N-linked glycosylation sites and a beta subunit of 118 residues containing one N-linked glycosylation site. The amino acid sequence of thyrotropin alfa is identical to that of human pituitary thyroid stimulating hormone. Pharmacology: Binding of thyrotropin alfa to TSH receptors on normal thyroid epithelial cells or on well-differentiated thyroid cancer tissue stimulates iodine uptake and organification. Thyrogen is an exogenous source of human TSH that offers an additional diagnostic tool in the follow-up of patients with a history of well-differentiated thyroid cancer. Mechanism of action: Thyrotropin Alfa binds to the thyrotropin receptors found on any residual thyroid cells or tissues. This stimulates radioactive iodine uptake for better radiodiagnostic imaging. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Diagnostic Agents"}}
