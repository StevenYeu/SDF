{"Timm's stain":{"RelatedTo":"Zinc(2+)","Synonym":["Timm's sulfide silver staining"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Silver stain","Id":"nlx_152595","Definition":"A staining technique used to visualize a variety of metals in brains and other tissues, including trace metals essential for life, such as Zn, Cu, Fe, Co, and Ni, as well as toxic metals, e.g., Hg, Cd, Pb, As, Bi, TI, Au and Ag. This method, originally developed by Timm (1958), was later modified. The technique is based on sulphide-precipitation of metals in tissue followed by a physical development. During the latter stage the metal sulphides catalyze the reduction of silver ions by reducing agents. This technique has proven to be particularly useful in visualizing zinc-containing neurons and the detection of newly sprouted axons and axon terminals within the central nervous system (Adapted from (http:\/\/www.neurodigitech.com\/services\/210403.html)"}}
