It has important effects in labour. It also stimulates osteoblasts to release factors which stimualtes bone resorption by osteoclasts. As a prescription drug it is used as a vaginal suppository, to prepare the cervix for labour and to induce labour. Pharmacology: Dinoprostone is equivalent to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). It stimulates labor and delivery and thus terminates pregnancy. Dinoprostone is also capable of stimulating the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract of man. This activity may be responsible for the vomiting and\/or diarrhea that is not uncommon when dinoprostone is used to terminate pregnancy. Mechanism of action: Dinoprostone administered intravaginally stimulates the myometrium of the gravid uterus to contract in a manner that is similar to the contractions seen in the term uterus during labor, resulting in the evacuation of the products of conception from the uterus. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Oxytocics. Prostaglandins"}}
