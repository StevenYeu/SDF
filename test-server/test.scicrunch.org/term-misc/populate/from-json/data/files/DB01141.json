{"Micafungin":{"RelatedTo":"Beta-1,3-glucan synthase","Synonym":["FK-463","micafungin"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB01141","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB01141","Definition":"Micafungin is an antifungal drug. It belongs to the antifungal class of compounds known as echinocandins and exerts its effect by inhibiting the synthesis of 1,3-beta-D-glucan, an integral component of the fungal cell wall. Pharmacology: Formerly known as FK463, micafungin is a novel antifungal agent. It is a glucan synthesis inhibitor of the echinocandin structural class. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved micafungin in March 2005. Micafungin inhibits an enzyme essential for fungal cell-wall synthesis and is fungicidal (lethal) for Candida. Micafungin can be used concomitantly with a variety of other drugs, including the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir and the transplant medications cyclosporine and tacrolimus. Mechanism of action: Micafungin inhibits the synthesis of 1,3-b-D-glucan, an essential component of fungal cell walls, which is not present in mammalian cells. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antifungal Agents. Antifungals"}}
