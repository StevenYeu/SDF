It is used as a hemostatic. Pharmacology: Felypressin is a synthetic analog of lypressin or vasopressin with more vasoconstrictor activity than antidiuretic action. It is used primarily as a hemostatic. Felypressin is a non-catecholamine vasoconstrictor that is chemically related to vasopressin, the posterior pituitary hormone. Mechanism of action: Felypressin binds to the vasopressin receptor V1a. This causes contraction of the smooth muscle in the vascular bed, especially capillaries, small arterioles and venules. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Renal Agents. Vasoconstrictor Agents"}}
