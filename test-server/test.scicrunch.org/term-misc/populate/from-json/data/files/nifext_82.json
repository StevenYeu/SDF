They express vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) 2 but not VGLUT1 or VGLUT3 (Ito and Oliver, 2010, 2011). Their main target is the medial geniculate body although they send axons to most auditory brainstem nuclei. Since majority of IC neurons are disc-shaped, which extend their dendrite parallel to isofrequency laminae (Oliver, 1984), majority of glutamatergic neurons are likely to be disc-shaped. Stellate neurons, which are less common and extend dendrite perpendicular to isofrequency laminae, also project to the medial geniculate body (Oliver, 1984)."}}
