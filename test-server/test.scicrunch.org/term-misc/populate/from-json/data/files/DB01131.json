It does this by inhibiting the enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase, which is involved in the reproduction of the parasite. Pharmacology: Proguanil is a biguanide derivative that is converted to an active metabolite called cycloguanil pamoate. It exerts its antimalarial action by inhibiting parasitic dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. It has causal prophylactic and suppressive activity against P. falciparum and cures the acute infection. It is also effective in suppressing the clinical attacks of vivax malaria. However it is slower compared to 4-aminoquinolines. Mechanism of action: Proguanil inhibits the dihydrofolate reductase of plasmodia and thereby blocks the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines, which are essential for DNA synthesis and cell multiplication. This leads to failure of nuclear division at the time of schizont formation in erythrocytes and liver. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antimalarials. Antimetabolites"}}
