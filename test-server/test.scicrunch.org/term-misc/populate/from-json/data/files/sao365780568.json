{"Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule":{"SuperCategory":"Cell Adhesion Molecule","Id":"sao365780568","Abbrev":"NCAM","Definition":"Cell adhesion molecule involved in a diverse range of contact-mediated interactions among neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and myotubes. It is widely but transiently expressed in many tissues early in embryogenesis. Four main isoforms exist, including CD56; (ANTIGENS, CD56); but there are many other variants resulting from alternative splicing and post-translational modifications. (From Pigott & Power, The Adhesion Molecule FactsBook, 1993, pp115-119) (MSH)"}}
