(PubChem) Pharmacology: Levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antiinfective, is the optically active L-isomer of ofloxacin. Levofloxacin is used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis, sinusitis, chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia and pneumonia caused by penicillin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, skin and skin structure infections, complicated urinary tract infections and acute pyelonephritis. Mechanism of action: Levofloxacin inhibits bacterial type II topoisomerases, topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase. Levofloxacin, like other fluoroquinolones, inhibits the A subunits of DNA gyrase, two subunits encoded by the gyrA gene. This results in strand breakage on a bacterial chromosome, supercoiling, and resealing; DNA replication and transcription is inhibited. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents. Anti-Infective Agents, Urinary. Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors. Quinolones"}}
