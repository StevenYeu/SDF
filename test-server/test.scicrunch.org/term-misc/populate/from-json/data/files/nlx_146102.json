{"Temporal discounting task":{"Created":"5\/20\/2011 14:51","CurationStatus":"uncurated","Contributor":"Natalie Picchetti","CAO_Id":"CAO_00878","Cognitive_Atlas_Link":"http:\/\/www.cognitiveatlas.org\/concept\/Temporal_discounting_task","SuperCategory":"Behavioral Experimental Paradigm","Id":"nlx_146102","Definition":"refers to the tendency of people to discount rewards as they approach a temporal horizon in the future or the past (i.e., become so distant in time that they cease to be valuable or to have additive effects). To put it another way, it is a tendency to give greater value to rewards as they move away from their temporal horizons and towards the and#34;nowand#34;. For instance, a nicotine deprived smoker may highly value a cigarette available any time in the next 6 hours but assign little or no value to a cigarette available in 6 months."}}
