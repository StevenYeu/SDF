It antagonizes or reduces bronchospasm caused, principally in asthmatics, by an allergic reaction to accidentally or inadvertently encountered allergens. Pharmacology: Pranlukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor-1 antagonist. Mechanism of action: Pranlukast selectively antagonizes leukotriene D4 (LTD4) at the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor, CysLT1, in the human airway. Pranlukast inhibits the actions of LTD4 at the CysLT1 receptor, preventing airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and enhanced secretion of thick, viscous mucus. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Asthmatic Agents. Leukotriene Antagonists"}}
