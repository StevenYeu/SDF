{"Node Of Ranvier":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Supra Cellular Structure","Id":"birnlex_1152","DefiningCitation":"umlscui::C0034667","Definition":"Specialized supracellular structures found in myelinated axons at the gaps between the myelin sheaths.  The Node of Ranvier consists of the axonal membrane at the gap, the surrounding myelin processes and additional components such as astrocytic processes or basal lamina, depending upon whether the Node occurs in axons in the peripheral or central nervous system."}}
