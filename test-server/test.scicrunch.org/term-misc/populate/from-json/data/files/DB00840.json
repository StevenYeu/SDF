Lacrisertis a formulation of hydroxypropyl cellulose that is used for artificial tears. It is used to treat syndromes characterized by insufficient tear production (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), recurrent corneal erosions, decreased corneal sensitivity, exposure and neuroparalytic keratitis, and as a lubricant for artificial eyes. As a food additive, hydroxypropyl cellulose is used as a thickener and as an emulsion stabilizer. Pharmacology: Hydroxypropyl cellulose (cellulose, 2-hydroxypropyl ether) is a derivative of cellulose with both water solubility and organic solubility. Hydroxypropyl cellulose acts to stabilize and thicken the precorneal tear film and prolong the tear film breakup time which is usually accelerated in patients with dry eye states. Hydroxypropyl cellulose also acts to lubricate and protect the eye. Hydroxypropyl cellulose usually reduces the signs and symptoms resulting from moderate to severe dry eye syndromes, such as conjunctival hyperemia, corneal and conjunctival staining with rose bengal, exudation, itching, burning, foreign body sensation, smarting, photophobia, dryness and blurred or cloudy vision. Progressive visual deterioration which occurs in some patients may be retarded, halted, or sometimes reversed. Mechanism of action: Hydroxypropyl cellulose is a derivative of cellulose that is soluble in both water and organic solvents. It is particularly good at trapping water and producing a film that serves as a barrier to water loss. Hydroxypropyl cellulose possesses good surface activity but does not gel as it forms open helical coils. In general Hydroxypropyl cellulose is a water-soluble thickener, emulsifier and film-former often used in tablet coating. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Artificial Tears. Ophthalmic Protectant"}}
