Brodmann-1909 regarded it as topographically and cytoarchitecturally homologous to the human rostral postcentral area 3. Distinctive features (Brodmann-1905): compared to area 1 of Brodmann-1909 and area 2 of Brodmann-1909 the cortical thickness of area 3 is unusually thin, in fact, among the thinnest areas of the cerebral cortex; the cells of sublayer 3b of the external pyramidal layer (III) are smaller, plumper and more densely distributed in a tighter strip; cells of the internal granular layer (IV) are distributed more sparsely; the internal pyramidal layer (V) is relatively clear with scattered large to very large pyramid shaped ganglion cells separated by tangentially oriented fiber bundles; the multiform layer (VI) is composed of a dense population of homogeneously distributed cells such that sublayers are absent and the boundary with the subcortical white matter is distinct. According to Roberts-63 the external granular layer (II), layer III and layer IV are not clearly demarcated from each other and are all densely packed with small cells.Definition Source: NeuroNamesAbbreviation Source: SumsDB_abbrevSource"}}
