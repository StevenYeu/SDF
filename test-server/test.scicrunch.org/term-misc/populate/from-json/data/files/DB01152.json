Candicidin is administered intravaginally in the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Pharmacology: Candicidin is a polyene antifungal antibiotic produced by a strain of Streptomyces griseus. It is especially effective against Candida albicans (more effective than amphotericin B), and is administered intravaginally in the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Mechanism of action: Ergosterol, the principal sterol in the fungal cytoplasmic membrane, is the target site of action of Candicidin. Candicidin binds irreversibly to ergosterol, resulting in disruption of membrane integrity and ultimately cell death. There is some evidence that the binding site in the cell wall may be to fatty acids or fatty acid esters and that this binding capacity must be satisfied before candicidin can bring about its lethal effect by binding to sterol in the cell membrane. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents. Antifungal Agents. Macrolides"}}
