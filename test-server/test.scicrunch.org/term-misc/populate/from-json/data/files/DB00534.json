The radiolabeled form has been used as a diagnostic and research tool. It is no longer used and has been replaced with new classes of diuretic drugs. Pharmacology: Chlormerodrin is a mercurial compound with toxic side effects. It is no longer used and has been replaced with new classes of diuretic drugs. Mechanism of action: Chlormerodrin most likely acts by a direct renal action. Mercurial diuresis is presumed to occur through inhibition of reabsorption of water and electrolytes in the convoluted tubules, although the problem of whether the locus of action is primarily on the proximal or distal portion has not yet been settled. There is also evidence that mercurials interfere with the permeability of the membrane of tubular cells by increasing passive influx of Na+ ion, Cl- ion and water into the cells, without interfering with the active extrusion of Na+ ion. Lastly, there is some evidence that chlormerodrin inhibits succinic dehydrogenase, but the clinical significance of this binding is not known. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Diagnostic aids. Mercurial Diuretics"}}
