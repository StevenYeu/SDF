(Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Tenofovir belongs to a class of antiretroviral drugs known as nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs), which block reverse transcriptase, an enzyme crucial to viral production in HIV-infected people. Tenofovir is currently in late-stage clinical trials for the treatment of hepatitis B. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate diester analog of adenosine monophosphate. Tenofovir requires initial diester hydrolysis for conversion to tenofovir and subsequent phosphorylations by cellular enzymes to form tenofovir diphosphate. Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases , , and mitochondrial DNA polymerase . Mechanism of action: Tenofovir inhibits the activity of HIV reverse transcriptase by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine 5-triphosphate and, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-HIV Agents. Nucleoside and Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors. Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors"}}
