{"Open field test":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Behavioral Experimental Paradigm","Id":"nlx_152173","Species":"Rodent","Abbrev":"OFT","Definition":"A commonly used qualitative and quantitative measure of general locomotor activity and willingness to explore in rodents. Originally developed as a test of emotionality by Calvin Hall (1932). The open field is an arena with walls to prevent escape. Commonly, the field is marked with a grid, and square crossings, rearing, and time spent moving are used to assess the activity of the rodent. In the modern open field apparatus, infrared beams or video cameras with associated software can be used to automate the assessment process. The OFT is also often used to assess anxiety by including additional measures of defecation, time spent in the center of the field, and the first few minutes of activity. The relation between the OFT and other tests of exploratory activity (elevated plus maze and emergence) have been analyzed in two mouse strains. Changes in these measures are often used to assess the sedative or stimulant effects of pharmacological agents (adapted from Wikipedia:  http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Open_Field_(animal_test%))."}}
