It is commonly used in the treatment of epilepsy. It has agonistic activity for both the GABAA and GABAB receptors. Progabide has been investigated for many diseases besides epilepsy, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, clinical depression and anxiety disorder with varying success. Pharmacology: Progabide, a fatty acid derivative, is a GABA receptor agonist used to treat the symptoms of epilepsy. Mechanism of action: Progabide binds to both GABAA and GABAB receptors located on the terminals of primary afferent fibers. Binding to GABAA results in an increased affinity of the GABA receptor for the amino acid, an augmented flux of chloride ions across the terminal membrane, and an increase in the amount of presynaptic inhibition. Activation of the GABAB receptors retards the influx of calcium ions into the terminals, thereby reducing the evoked release of excitatory amino acids and possibly other transmitters.
