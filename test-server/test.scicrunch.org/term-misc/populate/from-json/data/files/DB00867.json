(PubChem) Pharmacology: Beta-2 adrenergic receptors are located at sympathetic neuroeffector junctions of many organs, including uterus. Ritodrine is beta-2 adrenergic agonist. It stimulates beta-2 adrenergic receptor, increases cAMP level and decreases intracellular calcium concentration. The decrease of calcium concentration leads to a relaxation of uterine smooth muscle. Mechanism of action: Ritodrine is beta-2 adrenergic agonist. It binds to beta-2 adrenergic receptors on outer membrane of myometrial cell, activates adenyl cyclase to increase the level of cAMP which decreases intracellular calcium and leads to a decrease of uterine contractions. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Adrenergic beta-Agonists. Sympathomimetic. Sympathomimetics. Tocolytic Agents"}}
