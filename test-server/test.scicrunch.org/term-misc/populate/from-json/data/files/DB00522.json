It is given by mouth as a noninvasive test. The amount of 4-aminobenzoic acid and its metabolites excreted in the urine is taken as a measure of the chymotrypsin-secreting activity of the pancreas. Headache and gastrointestinal disturbances have been reported in patients taking bentiromide. Bentiromide is not available in the U.S. or Canada (It was withdrawn in the US in October 1996). Pharmacology: Bentiromide is a peptide used as a screening test for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and to monitor the adequacy of supplemental pancreatic therapy. It is given by mouth as a noninvasive test. The amount of p-aminobenzoic acid and its metabolites excreted in the urine is taken as a measure of the chymotrypsin-secreting activity of the pancreas. Headache and gastrointestinal disturbances have been reported in patients taking bentiromide. Bentiromide is not available in the U.S. or Canada. Mechanism of action: Bentiromide is a peptide that is broken down in the pancreas by lipase, protease, and amylase. By determining the output of unchanged bentiromide in the urine following oral administration, it is possible to determine the sufficiency of pancreatic activity. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Diagnostic aids. Indicators and Reagents"}}
