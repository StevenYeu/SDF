CA1 Interneuron Specific (IS) type III cells are VIP+, calretinin+ and terminals mGluR7a+. The soma is located mainly in stratum pyramidale and radiatum with radial dendrites crossing most layers (Acsady et al. 1996a,b). The axon innervates mainly O-LM cells (Acsady et al. 1996a; Ferraguti et al. 2004) and terminals express high level of mGluR7a in the presynaptic active zone (Somogyi et al. 2003)."}}
