{"Hippocampal Formation of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["hippocampus p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","PartiallyOverlapsWith":["Hippocampus"],"Comment":"The overlaps relationships were determined from the description","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151529","ParcellationScheme":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme","Is part of":"Pallium of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"The hippocampal formation is readily segmented on coronal T2-weighted MRI. The rostral extent of the hippocampus appears as a light ellipsoid structure emerging from the much darker surrounding ventral hippocampal commissure. Moving caudally the hippocampus is bounded on all sides by much darker structures: the corpus callosum dorsally, the fimbria laterally, and the diencephalon ventrally. Further caudal, the hippocampus becomes completely bounded laterally by the corpus callosum\/external capsule\/deep cerebral white matter complex, and medially by the diencephalon and internal capsule\/cerebral peduncle, all of which appear much darker on T2 MRI. At its caudal extent the hippocampal formation still shares a lateral boundary with the corpus callosum. The medial border is somewhat more subtle and is defined by the thin, dark, speckled edge of the molecular layer of the subiculum."}}
