{"GABA-B Receptor":{"Synonym":["GABAB","GABA B Receptor","GABA_B"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"G-protein_coupled_receptor","Id":"nlx_mol_090801","Has role":"GABA Receptor,","Definition":"Cell surface proteins which bind GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC ACID and influence cells via interactions with G-proteins. GABA-B receptors are pharmacologically characterized by their insensitivity to the blocker bicuculline and sensitivity to the agonist L-baclofen. They are found both presynaptically and postsynaptically, and act variously by inhibition of adenylate cyclase, activation of phospholipase A2, activation of potassium channels, and inactivation of voltage-activated calcium channels.Year introduced: 1994  - definition from MeSH"}}
