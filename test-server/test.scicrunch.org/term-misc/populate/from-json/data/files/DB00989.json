Rivastigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that inhibits both butyrylcholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase. Pharmacology: Rivastigmine is a parasympathomimetic and a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor. Rivastigmine is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Pathological changes in Dementia of the Alzheimer type involve cholinergic neuronal pathways that project from the basal forebrain to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. These pathways are thought to be intricately involved in memory, attention, learning, and other cognitive processes. While the precise mechanism of rivastigmine's action is unknown, it is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function. This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by cholinesterase. If this proposed mechanism is correct, rivastigmine's effect may lessen as the disease process advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact. Mechanism of action: Rivastigmine increases the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by cholinesterase. This acts to enhance cholinergic function.
