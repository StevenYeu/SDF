# SDF Catalog

The catalog will facilitate the discovery, dissemination, and reuse of NSF funded products, and help in reporting on the evaluation metrics as defined by the product owners.

The catalog is based on the [SciCrunch Portal](https://github.com/SciCrunch/SciCrunch-Portal) and has been modified to work with SDF specific data

## How to run 

### Prerequisites  
- Domain name
- SSL certs 
- Docker

The current configuration expects SSL certs and a domain name. 
NOTE: some of the links in source code may reference SDF domain name. That will need to change your own domain name. The `config.php` will need to be updated with the domain name too.

### Run app using Docker
1. Copy `docker-compose-example.yml` to a new file called `docker-compose.yml`
2. Replace all of the `FILL_IN`  with the appropriate values and update the SSL cert location.
3. Run `docker-compose up -d` (or `docker compose up -d` depending on the version of docker)
