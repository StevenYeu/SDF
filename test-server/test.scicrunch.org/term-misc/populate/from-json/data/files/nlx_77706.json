{"Lipid peroxidation":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Biological process","Id":"nlx_77706","Definition":"The oxidative degradation of lipids whereby free radicals \"steal\" electrons from the lipids in cell membranes, resulting in cell damage. This process proceeds by a free radical chain reaction mechanism. It most often affects polyunsaturated fatty acids, because they contain multiple double bonds in between which lie methylene -CH2- groups that possess especially reactive hydrogens. As with any radical reaction the reaction consists of three major steps: initiation, propagation and termination (adapted from Wikipedia)"}}
