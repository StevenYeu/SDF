Pharmacology: Prevents excessive accumulation of active neutrophil elastase and consequent proteolysis of elastin tissues in alveolar lung structures. This prevents the development of emphysema. Mechanism of action: Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor is a serine protease inhibitor (Serpin). It primarily inhibits the action of the serine protease called elastase (also plasmin and thrombin). The reactive center loop (RCL) of alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor extends out from the body of the protein and directs binding to the target protease. The protease cleaves the serpin at the reactive site, establishing a covalent linkage between the carboxyl group of the serpin reactive site and the serine hydroxyl of the protease. The resulting inactive serpin-protease complex is highly stable. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Enzyme Replacement Agents"}}
