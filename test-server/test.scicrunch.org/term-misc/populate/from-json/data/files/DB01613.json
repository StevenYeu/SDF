(From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1020) Pharmacology: Erythrityl Tetranitrate is a vasodilator with general properties similar to nitroglycerin. Mechanism of action: Similar to other nitrites and organic nitrates, erythrityl tetranitrate is converted to an active intermediate compound which activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase. This stimulates the synthesis of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) which then activates a series of protein kinase-dependent phosphorylations in the smooth muscle cells, eventually resulting in the dephosphorylation of the myosin light chain of the smooth muscle fiber. The subsequent release of calcium ions results in the relaxation of the smooth muscle cells and vasodilation. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Nitrates and Nitrites.
