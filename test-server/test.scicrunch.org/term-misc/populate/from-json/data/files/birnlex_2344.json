Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify it. For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. The GPL requires that source code to a tool or resource be made available, and that modified versions of the tool or resource (including new tools which include part of the original tool's source) make the modified source available to users.A developer of a tool or resource distributed under the GPL ensures that users of the tool and of modified versions of the tool may always inspect the source code and modify the source to suit their needs, and that users may modify the tool as they see fit without being obliged to distribute their changes.  While this may seem to encourage multiple versions of the same tool, the result is often that changes are passed back to the tool originator and incorporated into the original tool. (NITRC)The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or simply GPL) is a widely used free software license, originally written by Richard Stallman for the GNU project. The GPL is the most popular and well-known example of the type of strong copyleft license that requires derived works to be available under the same copyleft. Under this philosophy, the GPL is said to grant the recipients of a computer program the rights of the free software definition and uses copyleft to ensure the freedoms are preserved, even when the work is changed or added to. This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD licenses are the standard examples."}}
