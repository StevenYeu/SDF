{"Parcellation scheme":{"EditorialNote":"Should this definition be modified to include a Gaussian distribution to represent distribution of cells or other features?  I changed the definition to include all anatomical entities and not just brain, as we also have parcellation schemes for spinal cord and other parts of the nervous system","Synonym":"Partition scheme","CurationStatus":"graph position temporary","SuperCategory":"Role","Curator":["Maryann Martone"],"Id":"nlx_144019","Definition":"Set  of parcels occupying part or all of an anatomical entity that has been delineated using a common approach or set of criteria, often in a single study.  A parcellation scheme for any given individual entity may include gaps, transitional zones, or regions of uncertainty.  A parcellation scheme derived from a set of individuals registered to a common target (atlas) may be probabilistic and include overlap of parcels in regions that reflect individual variability or imperfections in alignment."}}
