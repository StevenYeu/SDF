The cell body fiber ascends through the median bundle to the level of the gamma lobe before making a steep lateral turn and forming extensive branches in the inferior neuropils. Some branches further arborize in the superior neuropils posterior to the vertical lobe. The main fiber further projects towards the vertical lobe and arborizes extensively in the alpha' lobe.","hasDBXref":"FlyBrain_NDB:10464"}}
