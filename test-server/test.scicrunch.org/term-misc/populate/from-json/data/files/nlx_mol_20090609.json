{"Green fluorescent protein":{"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Fluorescent protein","Id":"nlx_mol_20090609","Abbrev":"GFP","Definition":"A naturally occuring fluorescent protein of 238 amino acids (26.9 kDa), originally isolated from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria that fluoresces green when exposed to blue light.  The GFP from A. victoria has a major excitation peak at a wavelength of 395 nm and a minor one at 475 nm. Its emission peak is at 509 nm which is in the lower green portion of the visible spectrum. The GFP from the sea pansy (Renilla reniformis) has a single major excitation peak at 498 nm. In cell and molecular biology, the GFP gene is frequently used as a reporter of expression. In modified forms it has been used to make biosensors, and many animals have been created that express GFP as a proof-of-concept that a gene can be expressed throughout a given organism.
