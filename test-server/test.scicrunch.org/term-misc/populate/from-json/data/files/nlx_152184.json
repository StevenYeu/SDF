{"Retina outer plexiform layer":{"Synonym":"external plexiform layer","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Cell layer","Id":"nlx_152184","Is part of":"Retina","Definition":"A layer of neuronal synapses in the retina of the eye, bounded by the inner nuclear layer and the outer nuclear layer. It consists of a dense network of synapses between dendrites of horizontal cells from the inner nuclear layer, and photoreceptor cell inner segments from the outer nuclear layer. It is much thinner than the inner plexiform layer, where amacrine cells cells synapse with retinal ganglion cells (adapted from Wikipedia: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Outer_plexiform_layer)"}}
