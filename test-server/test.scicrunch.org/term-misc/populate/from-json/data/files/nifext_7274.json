The D5 subtype is a G-protein coupled receptor which stimulates adenylyl cyclase.This receptor is expressed in neurons in the limbic regions of the brain, especially in the hippocampus and the hypothalamus. It has a 10-fold higher affinity for dopamine than the D1 subtype. Pseudogenes related to this gene reside on chromosome 1 and chromosome 2. (Adapted from Entrez Gene)."}}
