Characterized by a spiny apical dendritic tree in the molecular layer and a smooth basal dendritic tree in the deep layer.  The apical dendrites have many branches which are contacted by parallel fibers from granule cells, whereas the basal dendrites have few branches and receive inputs from the auditory nerve."}}
