{"Anisindione":{"RelatedTo":"Vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylase","Synonym":["Anisin indandione","Miradon"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB01125","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB01125","Definition":"Anisindione is a synthetic anticoagulant and an indanedione derivative. It prevents the formation of active procoagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as the anticoagulant proteins C and S, in the liver by inhibiting the vitamin K  mediated gamma-carboxylation of precursor proteins. Pharmacology: Anisindione is a synthetic anticoagulant and an indanedione derivative. It is prescribed only if you cannot take coumarin-type anticoagulants such as coumadin as anisindione is a powerful drug with serious potential side effects. Anticoagulants decrease the clotting ability of the blood and therefore help to prevent harmful clots from forming in the blood vessels. These medicines are sometimes called blood thinners, although they do not actually thin the blood. They also will not dissolve clots that already have formed, but they may prevent the clots from becoming larger and causing more serious problems. Mechanism of action: Like phenindione, to which it is related chemically, anisindione exercises its therapeutic action by reducing the prothrombin activity of the blood. Anisindione prevents the formation of active procoagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as the anticoagulant proteins C and S, in the liver by inhibiting the vitamin Kmediated gamma-carboxylation of precursor proteins. Anisindione has no direct thrombolytic effect and does not reverse ischemic tissue damage, although it may limit extension of existing thrombi and prevent secondary thromboembolic complications. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anticoagulants"}}
