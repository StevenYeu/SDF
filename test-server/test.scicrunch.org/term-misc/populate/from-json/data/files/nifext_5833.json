D2 receptors have a high affinity for antipsychotic drugs and have higher levels of expression in mammalian hippocampus and hypothalamus. It is encoded by the DRD2 gene in humans and a missense mutation in this gene causes myoclonus dystonia; other mutations have been associated with schizophrenia. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants encoding different isoforms. A third variant has been described, but it has not been determined whether this form is normal or due to aberrant splicing. (adapted from Entrez Gene)."}}
