Pharmacology: Eptifibatide is an anti-coagulant that selectively blocks the platelet glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa receptor. Eptifibatide is a cyclic heptapeptide derived from a protein found in the venom of the southeastern pygmy rattlesnake (Sistrurus miliarus barbouri). It belongs to the class of the so called arginin-glycin-aspartat-mimetics and reversibly binds to platelets. Mechanism of action: Eptifibatide inhibits platelet aggregation by reversibly binding to the platelet receptor glycoprotein (GP) IIb\/IIIa of human platelets, thus preventing the binding of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and other adhesive ligands. Inhibition of platelet aggregation occurs in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner. Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational. Drug category: Anticoagulants. Antiplatelet Agents. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}}
