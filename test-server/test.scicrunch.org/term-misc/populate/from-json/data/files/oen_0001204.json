{"Relative refractory state":{"RelatedTo":["Refractory state"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Action potential characteristic","Id":"oen_0001204","Definition":"A period of time, usually after the firing of an action potential, where the cell is less likely to fire a subsequent action potential, however the cell can be made to fire an action potential.  The mechanism includes the activation of additional potassium currents in the cell that move the membrane potential close to the equilibrium for potassium."}}
