{"S129A Alpha-Synuclein Drosophila":{"PMID":"15834418","CurationStatus":"uncurated","Pages":"657-663","PublicationDate":"April 17 2005","JournalVolume":"8","PublicationName":"Nature Neuroscience","Id":"nlx_organ_090803","JournalNumber":"5","Authors":"Li Chen and Mel B Feany","Title":"Alpha-Synuclein Phosphorylation controls neurotoxicity and inclusion formation in a Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease","Figure":"2,3","Definition":"This transgenic drosophila bears alpha-synuclein with a mutation at serine 129, the location where phosphorylation takes place.  This mutation was created with site-directed mutagenesis by replacing the serine codon with an alanine codon, which blocks phosphorylation.  These drosophila exhibit no symptoms of neurodegeneration."}}
