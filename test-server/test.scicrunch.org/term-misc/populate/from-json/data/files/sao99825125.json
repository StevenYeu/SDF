This protein plays a role in ion transport. After binding acetylcholine, the AChR responds by an extensive change in conformation that affects all subunits and leads to opening of an ion-conducting channel across the plasma membrane. Neuronal AChR is composed of two different types of subunits: alpha and beta. Alpha-3 subunit can be combined to beta-2 or beta-4 to give rise to functional receptors. Interacts with RIC3; which is required for proper folding and assembly. (Adapted from NCBI and Swiss-Prot)."}}
