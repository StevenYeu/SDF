It inhibits bone resorption and soft tissue calcification. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Clodronate is a first generation (non-nitrogenous) bisphosphonate in the same family as etidronate and tiludronate. Clodronate affects calcium metabolism and inhibits bone resorption and soft tissue calcification. Of the clodronate that is resorbed (from oral preparation) or infused (for intravenous drugs), about 50% is excreted unchanged by the kidney. The remainder has a very high affinity for bone tissue, and is rapidly absorbed onto the bone surface. Clodronate has been shown to prevent or delay skeletal-related events and decrease bone pain as well as normalize calcium levels in the presence of hypercalcemia. Mechanism of action: The bisphosphonate group binds strongly to the bone mineral, hydroxyapatite. This explains the specific pharmacological action of these compounds on mineralized tissues, especially bone. The exact mechanism of action of clodronate is not known, however it is known that it does not inhibit protein isoprenylation but can be metabolized intracellularly to a --methylene (AppCp-type) analog of ATP (AppCCl2p), which is cytotoxic to macrophages in vitro. Inhibition of the ADP\/ATP translocase by the metabolite AppCCl2p is a likely route by which clodronate causes osteoclast apoptosis and inhibits bone resorption. Recently, the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum was shown to take up bisphosphonates by pinocytosis. In these cells, clodronate, but not other pharmacologically active bisphosphonates, was incorporated into adenine nucleotides, which could potentially explain why this bisphosphonate sometimes seems to act differently than the other bisphosphonates. Clodronate, like all biphosphonates, also binds protein-tyrosine-phosphatase. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antihypocalcemic Agents. Antineoplastic Agents.
