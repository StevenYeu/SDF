{"Multiphoton microscope":{"Created":"2006-05-15","Synonym":["Multi-photon microscope"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Optical microscope","Curator":"Maryann Martone","Id":"birnlex_2116","Definition":"Optical microscope with a multiphoton attachment, where fluorescence excitation is produced by two or more photons of light of longer wavelength that the fluorophore.  On their own, these photons possess insufficient energy to excite the fluorophore but under certain conditions, the two photons can interact to produce excitation in a narrow focal plane."}}
