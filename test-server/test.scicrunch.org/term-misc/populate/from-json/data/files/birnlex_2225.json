{"Compiler":{"Created":"2007-03-07","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Software development tool","Id":"birnlex_2225","Definition":"A resource that provides a computer program (or set of programs) that transforms source code written in a computer language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language, often having a binary form known as object code). The most common reason for wanting to transform source code is to create an executable program. A \\\\u201ccompiler\\\\u201d is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language or machine language), and is likely to perform many or all of the following operations: lexical analysis, preprocessing, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation, and code optimization."}}
