{"Preoptic Area of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["preoptic p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151537","Is part of":"Subpallium of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"The preoptic area can be segmented on coronal diffusion-weighted images (DWI). The rostral extent of the preoptic area begins just caudal to the vertical limb of the diagonal band, which is quite dark (high diffusivity) compared to the preoptic area. Moving caudally, the preoptic area is bounded dorsally by the septum. A horizontal line connecting the ventral extent of the anterior limbs of the anterior commissure roughly approximates this border. Laterally, the preoptic area is bounded by the ventral pallidum and diagonal band, which both appear significantly darker on DWI. Further caudal, the lateral border is shared with the amygdala, which is slightly darker on DWI. The ventral border between the very dark preoptic area and the optic chiasm is straightforward. The caudal border between the preoptic area and the hypothalamus is not well defined. Our solution is to create an arbitrary plane dividing the two just caudal to the optic chiasm, or at roughly the level of the vertical descent of the fornix in to the hypothalamus."}}
