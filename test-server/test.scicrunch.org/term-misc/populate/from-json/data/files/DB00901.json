Bitolterol was withdrawn from the market by Elan Pharmaceuticals in 2001. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Bitolterol, an adrenergic bronchodilator, is a prodrug that widens constricted airways in the lungs by relaxing the smooth muscles that surround the bronchial passages. Bitolterol probably does not affect the inflammation in the lung, such as in bronchitis. Bitolterol is unique in that it is a prodrug because it must first be metabolized by the body before it becomes active. Mechanism of action: Bitolterol is an adrenergic beta-2 agonist. Asthma is a breathing involving narrowing of the bronchial tubes. This narrowing is caused by muscle spasm and inflammation within the bronchial tubes. Bitolterol relaxes the smooth muscles surrounding these airway tubes, therefore, increases the diameter and ease of air flow through the tubes. Drug type: Small Molecule. Withdrawn. Drug category: Bronchodilator Agents. Selective beta-2-adrenoreceptor agonists"}}
