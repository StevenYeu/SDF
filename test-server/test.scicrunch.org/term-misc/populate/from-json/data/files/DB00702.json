It is used primarily for ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) of diabetic patients and automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) for patients with end-stage renal disease. It is injected as a solution into the peritoneal cavity. The drug is absorbed via convective transport via peritoneal lymphatic pathways. Pharmacology: Icodextrin is an iso-osmotic peritoneal dialysis solution containing glucose polymers. It is used primarily for ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) of diabetic patients and automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) for patients with end-stage renal disease. It is injected as a solution into the peritoneal cavity. The drug is absorbed via convective transport via peritoneal lymphatic pathways. Mechanism of action: Icodextrin is a starch-derived, water-soluble glucose polymer linked by alpha (1-4) and alpha (1-6) glycosidic bonds with an average molecular weight between 13,000 and 19,000 daltons. It functions as a colloid osmotic agent to achieve ultrafiltration during long (12-16 hour) peritoneal dialysis dwells. In other words it helps clean waste out of the body when the kidneys are not functioning properly. Icodectrin acts in the peritoneal cavity by exerting osmotic pressure across small intercellular pores resulting in transcapillary ultrafiltration through the dwell. This is due to the fact that the polymer is minimially absorbed across the peritoneal membrane. Icodextrin achieves superior fluid removal compared with glucose-based dialysates. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Osmotic Agents"}}
