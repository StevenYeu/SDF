It extends thin branches laterally in the dorsal protocerebrum, shorter branches along the cell neurites in the dorsal part of the median bundle and extensive arborizations in the tritocerebrum (Enell et al., 2010). The two branches follow the aorta and innervate the corpus cardiacum in the ring gland and the hypocerebral ganglion, near the cardiac valve of the midgut. One of the branches follows the stalk of the crop, whilst the other bifurcates, with each of these branches extending along each side of the midgut (Cao and Brown, 2001). Located in a bilateral cell body cluster of five to seven cells in each hemisphere (Cao and Brown, 2001, Broughton et al., 2005)."}}
