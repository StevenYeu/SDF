Two visual areas ('LOC' and 'LOP') are included within this V4d topologue based on retinotopic fMRI data.  The retinotopy in the human V4d topologue differed from previous reports in macaque V4d in that it was crude or nonexistent except for an overall bias for either central or peripheral stimuli in LOC and LOP respectively. Unlike some previous reports in macaque V4d, the human V4d topologue was not significantly color-selective. However, the V4d topologue did respond selectively to kinetic motion boundaries, consistent with previous human fMRI reports. Because striking differences were found between the retinotopy and functional properties of the human topologues of 'V4v' and 'V4d', it is unlikely that these two cortical regions are subdivisions of a singular human area 'V4' (adapted from Tootell and Hadjikhani 2001).","DefinitionPMID":"11278193"}}
