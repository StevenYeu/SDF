It is used in the treatment of asthma, cardiac dyspnea, and bronchitis. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Dyphylline, a xanthine derivative, is a bronchodilator used for relief of acute bronchial asthma and for reversible bronchospasm associated with chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Dyphylline is a xanthine derivative with pharmacologic actions similar to theophylline and other members of this class of drugs. Its primary action is that of bronchodilation, but it also exhibits peripheral vasodilatory and other smooth muscle relaxant activity to a lesser degree. Mechanism of action: The bronchodilatory action of dyphylline, as with other xanthines, is thought to be mediated through competitive inhibition of phosphodiesterase with a resulting increase in cyclic AMP producing relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Bronchodilator Agents. Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors. Respiratory Smooth Muscle Relaxants. Vasodilator Agents"}}
