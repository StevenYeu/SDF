{"Fimbria Fornix of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas":{"AtlasImage":["fimbria fornix p0.png"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas parcellation scheme region","Id":"nlx_151548","Is part of":"Major White Matter Structures of CIVM postnatal rat brain atlas","Definition":"The fimbria\/fornix\/ventral hippocampal commissure complex is easily segmented on coronal T2-weighted MRI. Rostrally the fimbria\/fornix appears as a dark, vertical band in the center of the relatively light septum. The border between the septum and fimbria is easily distinguishable on T2-weighted MRI where white matter tends to be much darker than nuclei. The lateral border between the fimbria and striatum is defined by a thin sliver of lateral ventricle. Ventrally, the border between the fornix and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis is also quite clear on T2 MRI. Caudally the midline fimbria fades in to the ventral hippocampal commissure, which is equally distinguishable from the lighter appearing surrounding tissues: the caudate laterally and the diencephalon ventrally. The fornix extends ventrally through the diencephalon and in to the hypothalamus as a very dark column. Further caudal, the fimbria appears as a dark Y-shaped region cupping the lateral extent of the hippocampus. As the ventral and dorsal portions of the hippocampus come together the fimbria fades in to the alveus."}}
