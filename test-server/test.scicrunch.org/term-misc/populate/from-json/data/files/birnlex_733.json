(MeSH) The ventral topographic division of the hindbrain; the dorsal topographic division is the cerebellum. The middle cerebellar peduncle on the periphery of the macrodissected adult human pons (\"bridge\" in English) was identified by Varolio (1573, Fig. I, f. 17v; also see Clarke & O'Malley 1996, pp. 634-635, 821). Collins (1685, see Tab. 48-L, his caudex of medulla oblongata) identified the pons as defined here, and Haller (1747, see translation by Mihles, 1754, pp. 287, 296) provided the term itself. Pons Varolii (Bell, 1802) is a synonym."}}
