Although receiving only ~5% of the innervating auditory nerve dendrites, the motile properties of the outer hair cells actively contribute to the sensitivity and frequency selectivity of the cochlea. The process of somatic electromotility, due to the presence of the motor protein, prestin, is essential for normal cochlear function.  Outer hair cell function is also directly influenced by efferent input from the medial superior olivary complex. (MSH)","DefinitionPMID":"20624897"}}
