It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December of 1997. Pharmacology: Cefdinir is a third generation cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity against enteric gram-negative rods. Cefdinir is stable in the presence of some, but not all, b-lactamase enzymes. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalosporins are susceptible to cefdinir. Cephalosporins work the same way as penicillins: they interfere with the peptidoglycan synthesis of the bacterial wall by inhibiting the final transpeptidation needed for the cross-links. This effect is bactericidal. Mechanism of action: As with other cephalosporins, bactericidal activity of cefdinir results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis by acting on penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents. Anti-Infectives. Cephalosporins"}}
