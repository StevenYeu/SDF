Auranofin appears to induce heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) mRNA. Heme oxygenase 1 is an inducible heme-degrading enzyme with anti-inflammatory properties. Pharmacology: Auranofin is a gold salt used in treating inflammatory arthritis. Gold salts are called second-line drugs because they are often considered when the arthritis progresses in spite of antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs and corticosteroids). Mechanism of action: Exactly how auranofin works is not well understood. In patients with inflammatory arthritis, such as adult and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, gold salts can decrease the inflammation of the joint lining. This effect can prevent destruction of bone and cartilage. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antirheumatic Agents, Gold"}}
