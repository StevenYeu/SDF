One of their characteristic features is the fact that the cell body always lies outside within the confines of the dendritic tree. They have the highest eccentricity of body relative to dendritic field of all ganglion cell identified. The majority of RGB1 cells analysed stratify diffusely within the IPL; nevertheless, their dendritic trees are centred in either the on to  or the off to  sublaminae of the IPL (Table 1). RGB1 cells were found across the retina. 1 cells had curvy but generally radially branching dendrites (Fig. 5A). They ramified in the outer IPL close to the middle."}}
