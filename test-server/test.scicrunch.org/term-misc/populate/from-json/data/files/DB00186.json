It also has hypnotic, anticonvulsant, and considerable sedative properties and has been proposed as a preanesthetic agent. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine not transformed to active metabolites, is used to treat anxiety, status epilepticus, and for sedation induction and anterograde amnesia. Mechanism of action: Lorazepam binds to central benzodiazepine receptors which interact allosterically with GABA receptors. This potentiates the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, increasing the inhibition of the ascending reticular activating system and blocking the cortical and limbic arousal that occurs following stimulation of the reticular pathways. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-anxiety Agents. Anticonvulsants. Antiemetics. Benzodiazepines. GABA Modulators. Hypnotics and Sedatives"}}
