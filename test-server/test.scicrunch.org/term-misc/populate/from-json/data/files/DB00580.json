{"Valdecoxib":{"RelatedTo":"Prostaglandin G\/H synthase 2","Synonym":["valdecoxib"],"SuperCategory":"Molecular entity","Comment":"taken from DrugBank","Id":"DB00580","Curator":"ab","Has role":"Drug","DefiningCitation":"http:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/drugs\/DB00580","Definition":"Valdecoxib was removed from the Canadian, U.S., and E.U. markets in 2005 due to concerns about possible increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Pharmacology: Valdecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, is classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Valdecoxib is used for its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities in the management of osteoarthritis (OA) and for the treatment of dysmenorrhea or acute pain. Unlike celecoxib, valdecoxib lacks a sulfonamide chain and does not require CYP450 enzymes for metabolism. Mechanism of action: Both COX-1 and COX-2 catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) H2, the precursor of PGs and thromboxane. Valdecoxib selectively inhibits the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, important for the mediation of inflammation and pain. Unlike non-selective NSAIDs, valdecoxib does not inhibit platelet aggregation. Drug type: Investigational. Small Molecule. Withdrawn. Drug category: Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal.
