Marketed under the brand name Relafen, it has been shown to have a slightly lower risk of gastrointestinal side effects than most other non-selective NSAID's. Pharmacology: Nabumetone is a naphthylalkanone. It is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties in pharmacologic studies. As with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, its mode of action is not known. However, the ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis may be involved in the anti-inflammatory effect. Mechanism of action: The parent compound is a prodrug, which undergoes hepatic biotransformation to the active component, 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6MNA), that is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, most likely through binding to the COX-1 and COX-2 receptors. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal. Antineoplastic Agents"}}
