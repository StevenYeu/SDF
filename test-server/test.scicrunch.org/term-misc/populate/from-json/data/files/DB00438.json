(PubChem) Pharmacology: Ceftazidime is a semisynthetic, broad-spectrum, beta-lactam antibiotic for parenteral administration. Ceftazidime is bactericidal in action exerting its effect by inhibition of enzymes responsible for cell-wall synthesis. A wide range of gram-negative organisms is susceptible to ceftazidime in vitro, including strains resistant to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides. In addition, ceftazidime has been shown to be active against gram-positive organisms. It is highly stable to most clinically important beta-lactamases, plasmid or chromosomal, which are produced by both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms and, consequently, is active against many strains resistant to ampicillin and other cephalosporins. Ceftazidime has activity against the gram-negative organisms Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae. Its activity against Pseudomonas is a distinguishing feature of ceftazidime among the cephalosporins. Mechanism of action: The bactericidal activity of ceftazidime results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents. Cephalosporins"}}
