{"Neocortex Cajal-Retzius cell":{"Located in":"Brain marginal zone","Created":"2008-10-20","Synonym":"Cajal-Retzius Cell","CurationStatus":"uncurated","SuperCategory":"Neuron","Curator":"Maryann Martone","Id":"nlx_cell_20081206","Species":"Human,","Definition":"Neurons of the human embryonic marginal zone which display, as a salient feature, radial ascending processes that contact the pial surface, and a horizontal axon plexus located in the deep marginal zone. These cells were first described by Retzius (Retzius, 1893, 1894) (see the cell labelled 'Retzius, 1893' in Fig. 1). There is consensus that homologous elements are present in the non-primate neocortex, where their morphology is much simpler, as initially described in 1891 by Cajal (Fig. 2) (Cajal, 1891). \\\\nThe definition of these cells has remained somewhat confusing, in part because Cajal and Retzius studied different species and different developmental stages, and also because their original publications have not been generally available. Meyer et al (1999)prefer to define 'Cajal\\\\u2013Retzius cells' loosely, as the family of Reln-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the marginal zone, and reserve the term of pioneer neurons for the early, Reln-negative preplate derivatives that settle in the MZ and project to sub-cortical levels.
