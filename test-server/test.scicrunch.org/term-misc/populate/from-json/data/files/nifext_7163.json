As with other dopamine receptor subtypes, the D4  receptor is activated by the neurotransmitter dopamine, however this specific subtype is enriched in expression in the frontal cortex, diencephalon, and the brain stem. It is also a target for drugs which treat schizophrenia  and Parkinson disease. The D4 receptor is considered to be D2-like in which the activated receptor inhibits the enzyme adenylate cyclase, thereby reducing the intracellular concentration of the second messenger cyclic AMP.
