Nelarabine is a purine nucleoside analog converted to its corresponding arabinosylguanine nucleotide triphosphate (araGTP), resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis and cytotoxicity. Pharmacology: Nelarabine is a purine nucleoside analog converted to its corresponding arabinosylguanine nucleotide triphosphate (araGTP), resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis and cytotoxicity. Pre-clinical studies suggest that T-cells are particularly sensitive to nelarabine. Mechanism of action: Nelarabine is a prodrug of the cytotoxic deoxyguanosine analogue 9--D-arabinofuranosylguanine (ara-G). The drug is ultimately metabolized into the active 5'-triphosphate ara-GTP, which disrupts DNA synthesis and induces apoptosis. Additional cytotoxic activities may exist, but these are not fully understood. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antineoplastic Agents"}}
