{"Bergmann Glial Cell":{"Soma Location":"Purkinje cell layer of cerebellar cortex","Synonym":["Bergmann glia","Bergmann astrocyte"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","Comment":"Core:Definition modified from Wikipedia by MM.  According to Reichenbach and Wolberg the Bergmann glia should be considered a type of radial astrocyte but some do not consider this a type of astrocyte","SuperCategory":"Radial Astrocyte","Id":"sao1299495391","Definition":"Type of radial astrocyte in the cerebellar cortex that have their cell bodies in the Purkinje cell layer and processes that extend into the molecular layer, terminating with bulbous endfeet at the pial surface. Bergmann glia express high densities of glutamate transporters that limit diffusion of the neurotransmitter glutamate during its release from synaptic terminals. Besides their role in early development of the cerebellum, Bergmann glia are also required for the pruning or addition of synapses."}}
