{"Cingulate gyrus":{"NeuronamesLink":"http:\/\/braininfo.rprc.washington.edu\/Scripts\/hiercentraldirectory.aspx?ID","Created":"2006-10-05","EditorialNote":"Will keep the NN \"gyri\" distinct from the BIRN \"cortex\" regions.  Should we later decide the intended meanings are the same, we can set the corresponding classes to be equivalent.  In the end, any such correspondence really would depend on how the various cortical areas defined by Brodmann or some other parcellation scheme as defined for the NN gyri relate to those cortical areas assigned to the BIRN coritical regions (BB)., UMLS includes a CUI for \"Cingulate cortex\" (C0598179) separate from this other for \"Cingulate gyrus\"., Note that in BrainMap.org, they mere list LimbicLobe.AnteriorCingulate.GrayMatter under which they included Brodmann areas 10, 24, 25, 32, & 33 and LimbicLobe.CingulateGyrus.GrayMatter under which they include Brodmann areas 23, 24, 31, and 32.  This indicates not all gray matter contained within the cingulate cortex lies within the cingulate gyrus - at least it doesn't according to BrainMap.org's parcellation., Now I see where my confusion derives from.  It relates to the fact this distinction between surface and volumetric, parenchymal structures is a bit unclear in NeuroNames.  There sulci are clearly listed as \"superficial\" (i.e., defining surfaces), whereas gyri as listed as \"volumetric structures\".  The organization of the parenchyma within the lobes of the cerebral cortex are largely given according to complex structures lumped into the \"ancillary terms\" - e.g., all of the Brodmann areas.  The implication for listing \"gyri\" as volumetric is that the cortical parenchyma lying underneath the gyral surface are also included in these gyral regions.  Therefore, it may in fact be correct to set the BIRN \"cingulate cortex\" ","Synonym":["cingulate region"],"CurationStatus":"uncurated","NeuronamesID":"141","Umlscui":"C0018427","SuperCategory":"Regional part of brain","Id":"birnlex_798","Is part of":"Limbic lobe","Species":"Human","Abbrev":"CG","Definition":"One of the convolutions on the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere.
