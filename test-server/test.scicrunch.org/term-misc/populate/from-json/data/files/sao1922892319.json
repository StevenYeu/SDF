{"Intercellular Junction Site":{"Comment":"The Cell_Cell_Contact_Zone and the Intercellular_Junction are not the same.  The junction only refers to the bridging complex and not the larger region where the junction resides.  The intercellular_Junction is part of a larger cell-cell contact zone.  The cell-cell contact zone may also contain additional junctions and cellular machinery related to the function of the junction.","SuperCategory":"Site","Id":"sao1922892319","Definition":"The site of cell-cell contact containing a morphologically identified junctional complex joining the two cells."}}
