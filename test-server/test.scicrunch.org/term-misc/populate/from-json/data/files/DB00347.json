(From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p378) Pharmacology: Paramethadione and trimethadione are anticonvulsants indicated in the control of absence (petit mal) seizures that are refractory to treatment with other medications. Dione anticonvulsants are used in the treatment of epilepsy. They act on the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce the number of seizures. Mechanism of action: Dione anticonvulsants reduce T-type calcium currents in thalamic neurons, including thalamic relay neurons. This raises the threshold for repetitive activity in the thalamus, and inhibits corticothalamic transmission. Thus, the abnormal thalamocortical rhythmicity, which is thought to underlie the 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharge seen on electroencephalogram(EEG) with absence seizures, is dampened. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anticonvulsants"}}
