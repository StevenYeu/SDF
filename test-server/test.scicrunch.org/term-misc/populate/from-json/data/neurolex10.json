(PubChem) Pharmacology: Pyrimethamine is an antiparasitic compound commonly used as an adjunct in the treatment of uncomplicated, chloroquine resistant, P. falciparum malaria. Pyrimethamine is a folic acid antagonist and the rationale for its therapeutic action is based on the differential requirement between host and parasite for nucleic acid precursors involved in growth. This activity is highly selective against plasmodia and Toxoplasma gondii. Pyrimethamine possesses blood schizonticidal and some tissue schizonticidal activity against malaria parasites of humans. However, the 4-amino-quinoline compounds are more effective against the erythrocytic schizonts. It does not destroy gametocytes, but arrests sporogony in the mosquito. The action of pyrimethamine against Toxoplasma gondii is greatly enhanced when used in conjunction with sulfonamides. Mechanism of action: Pyrimethamine inhibits the dihydrofolate reductase of plasmodia and thereby blocks the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines, which are essential for DNA synthesis and cell multiplication. This leads to failure of nuclear division at the time of schizont formation in erythrocytes and liver. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antimalarials. Antiprotozoal Agents.

In thiamine deficiency, its oxidation is retarded and it accumulates in the tissues, especially in nervous structures. (From Stedman, 26th ed) Pharmacology: Pyruvic acid or pyruvate is a key intermediate in the glycolytic and pyruvate dehydrogenase pathways, which are involved in biological energy production. Pyruvate is widely found in living organisms. It is not an essential nutrient since it can be synthesized in the cells of the body. Certain fruits and vegetables are rich in pyruvate. For example, an average-size red apple contains approximately 450 milligrams. Dark beer and red wine are also rich sources of pyruvate. Recent research suggests that pyruvate in high concentrations may have a role in cardiovascular therapy, as an inotropic agent. Supplements of this dietary substance may also have bariatric and ergogenic applications. Mechanism of action: Pyruvate serves as a biological fuel by being converted to acetyl coenzyme A, which enters the tricarboxylic acid or Krebs cycle where it is metabolized to produce ATP aerobically. Energy can also be obtained anaerobically from pyruvate via its conversion to lactate. Pyruvate injections or perfusions increase contractile function of hearts when metabolizing glucose or fatty acids. This inotropic effect is striking in hearts stunned by ischemia/reperfusion. The inotropic effect of pyruvate requires intracoronary infusion. Among possible mechanisms for this effect are increased generation of ATP and an increase in ATP phosphorylation potential. Another is activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, promoting its own oxidation by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is inactivated in ischemia myocardium. Yet another is reduction of cytosolic inorganic phosphate concentration. Pyruvate, as an antioxidant, is known to scavenge such reactive oxygen species as hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides. Indirectly, supraphysiological levels of pyruvate may increase cellular reduced glutathione. Drug type: Approved. Nutraceutical. Small Molecule. Drug category: Dietary supplement.

The antipsychotic effect of quetiapine is thought by some to be mediated through antagonist activity at dopamine and serotonin receptors. Specifically the D1 and D2 dopamine, the alpha 1 adrenoreceptor and alpha 2 adrenoreceptor, and 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 serotonin receptor subtypes are antagonized. Quetiapine also has an antagonistic effect on the histamine H1 receptor. Pharmacology: Quetiapine is a psychotropic agent belonging to the chemical class of benzisoxazole derivatives and is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. Quetiapine is a selective monoaminergic antagonist with high affinity for the serotonin Type 2 (5HT2), and dopamine type 2 (D2) receptors. Quetiapine is an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT1A and 5HT2, dopamine D1 and D2, histamine H1, and adrenergic alpha 1 and alpha 2 receptors. Quetiapine has no significant affinity for cholinergic muscarinic or benzodiazepine receptors. Drowsiness and orthostatic hypotension associated with use of quetiapine may be explained by its antagonism of histamine H1 and adrenergic alpha 1 receptors, respectively. Quetiapine's antagonism of adrenergic a1 receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug. Mechanism of action: The mechanism of action of quetiapine, as with other drugs used to treat schizophrenia, is unknown. However, it is thought that the drug's therapeutic activity in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) receptor antagonism. Although quetiapine is known to bind other receptors with similar affinity, only the dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT2 receptor binding is responsible for quetiapine's therapeutic activity in schizophrenia.

(PubChem) Pharmacology: Quinacrine has been used as an antimalarial drug and as an antibiotic. It is used to treat giardiasis, a protozoal infection of the intestinal tract, and certain types of lupus erythematosus, an inflammatory disease that affects the joints, tendons, and other connective tissues and organs. Quinacrine may be injected into the space surrounding the lungs to prevent reoccurrence of pneumothorax. The exact way in which quinacrine works is unknown. It appears to interfere with the parasite's metabolism. Mechanism of action: The exact mechanism of antiparasitic action is unknown; however, quinacrine binds to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in vitro by intercalation between adjacent base pairs, inhibiting transcription and translation to ribonucleic acid (RNA). Quinacrine does not appear to localize to the nucleus of Giaridia trophozoites, suggesting that DNA binding may not be the primary mechanism of its antimicrobial action. Fluorescence studies using Giardia suggest that the outer membranes may be involved. Quinacrine inhibits succinate oxidation and interferes with electron transport. In addition, by binding to nucleoproteins, quinacrine suppress the lupus erythematous cell factor and acts as a strong inhibitor of cholinesterase. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule.

Quinapril is actually a prodrug. It is converted to its active metabolite, quinaprilat, in the liver. Quinapril inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme, an enzyme which catalyses the formation of angiotensin II from its precursor, angiotensin I. Angiotensin II is a powerful vasoconstrictor and increases blood pressure through a variety of mechanisms. Pharmacology: Quinapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is used to treat hypertension and heart failure. Like ramipril, quinapril is a prodrug that, upon deesterification, is converted to the active metabolite quinaprilat. The effect of quinapril in hypertension and in congestive heart failure (CHF) appears to result primarily from the inhibition of circulating and tissue ACE activity, thereby reducing angiotensin II formation. Mechanism of action: Quinaprilat competes with angiotensin I for binding at the angiotensin-converting enzyme, blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and a negative-feedback mediator for renin activity, lower concentrations result in a decrease in blood pressure and stimulation of baroreceptor reflex mechanisms. Quinaprilat may also act on kininase II, an enzyme identical to ACE that degrades the vasodilator bradykinin. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule.

It was used commonly and as a bitter and flavoring agent, and is still useful for the treatment of babesiosis. Quinine is also useful in some muscular disorders, especially nocturnal leg cramps and myotonia congenita, because of its direct effects on muscle membrane and sodium channels. The mechanisms of its antimalarial effects are not well understood. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Quinine is used parenterally to treat life-threatening infections caused by chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Quinine acts as a blood schizonticide although it also has gametocytocidal activity against P. vivax and P. malariae. Because it is a weak base, it is concentrated in the food vacuoles of P. falciparum. It is thought to act by inhibiting heme polymerase, thereby allowing accumulation of its cytotoxic substrate, heme. As a schizonticidal drug, it is less effective and more toxic than chloroquine. However, it has a special place in the management of severe falciparum malaria in areas with known resistance to chloroquine. Mechanism of action: The theorized mechanism of action for quinine and related anti-malarial drugs is that these drugs are toxic to the malaria parasite. Specifically, the drugs interfere with the parasite's ability to break down and digest hemoglobin. Consequently, the parasite starves and/or builds up toxic levels of partially degraded hemoglobin in itself. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Analgesics, Non-Narcotic.

It is a prodrug - in the acid environment of the parietal cells it turns into active sulphenamide form. Rabeprazole inhibits the H+, K+ATPase of the coating gastric cells and dose-dependent oppresses basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion. Pharmacology: Rabeprazole prevents the production of acid in the stomach. It reduces symptoms and prevents injury to the esophagus or stomach in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or ulcers. Rabeprazole is also useful in conditions that produce too much stomach acid such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Rabeprazole may also be used with antibiotics to get rid of bacteria that are associated with some ulcers. Rabeprazole is a selective and irreversible proton pump inhibitor, suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+, K+ -ATPase enzyme system which is found at the secretory surface of parietal cells. It inhibits the final transport of hydrogen ions (via exchange with potassium ions) into the gastric lumen. Mechanism of action: Rabeprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds (substituted benzimidazole proton-pump inhibitors) that do not exhibit anticholinergic or histamine H2-receptor antagonist properties, but suppress gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H+/K+ATPase (hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase) at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor. Rabeprazole blocks the final step of gastric acid secretion. In gastric parietal cells, rabeprazole is protonated, accumulates, and is transformed to an active sulfenamide. When studied in vitro, rabeprazole is chemically activated at pH 1.2 with a half-life of 78 seconds. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Ulcer Agents.

Raloxifene decreases bone resorption, increases bone mineral density (BMD) and decreases incidence of fractures. Raloxifene is used in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis and breast cancer. Mechanism of action: Raloxifene binds to estrogen receptors, resulting in differential expression of multiple estrogen-regulated genes in different tissues. Raloxifene produces estrogen-like effects on bone, reducing resorption of bone and increasing bone mineral density in postmenopausal women. Raloxifene also antagonizes the effects of estrogen on mammary tissue and blocks uterotrophic responses to estrogen. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule.

Pharmacology: Ramelton is the first selective melatonin agonist. It works by mimicing melatonin (MT), a naturally occuring hormone that is produced during the sleep period. It has a high affinity for the MT1 and MT2 receptor. The MT1 and MT2 receptors are located in the brain's suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). The SCN is known as the body's \"master clock\" because it regulates the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle. Ramelton has an active metabolite that is less potent but circulates in higher concentrations than the parent compound. The metabolite also has weak affinity for the 5HT2b receptor. Mechanism of action: Ramelton is a melatonin receptor agonist with both high affinity for melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors and selectivity over the MT3 receptor.

It is used to treat gastrointestinal ulcers. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Ranitidine is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist similar to cimetidine and famotidine. An H2-receptor antagonist, often shortened to H2 antagonist, is a drug used to block the action of histamine on parietal cells in the stomach, decreasing acid production by these cells. These drugs are used in the treatment of dyspepsia, however their use has waned since the advent of the more effective proton pump inhibitors. Like the H1-antihistamines, the H2 antagonists are inverse agonists rather than true receptor antagonists. Mechanism of action: The H2 antagonists are competitive inhibitors of histamine at the parietal cell H2 receptor. They suppress the normal secretion of acid by parietal cells and the meal-stimulated secretion of acid. They accomplish this by two mechanisms: histamine released by ECL cells in the stomach is blocked from binding on parietal cell H2 receptors which stimulate acid secretion, and other substances that promote acid secretion (such as gastrin and acetylcholine) have a reduced effect on parietal cells when the H2 receptors are blocked.

It does not increase the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. In vitro studies suggest that ranolazine is a P-gp inhibitor. Ranolazine is believed to have its effects via altering the trans-cellular late sodium current.

Pharmacology: Rasagiline, an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO). MAO, a flavin-containing enzyme, is classified into two major molecular species, A and B, and is localized in mitochondrial membranes throughout the body in nerve terminals, brain, liver and intestinal mucosa. MAO regulates the metabolic degradation of catecholamines and serotonin in the CNS and peripheral tissues. MAO-B is the major form in the human brain. In ex vivo animal studies in brain, liver and intestinal tissues rasagiline was shown to be a potent, irreversible monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) selective inhibitor. Rasagiline at the recommended therapeutic dose was also shown to be a potent and irreversible inhibitor of MAO-B in platelets. The selectivity of rasagiline for inhibiting only MAO-B (and not MAO-A) in humans and the sensitivity to tyramine during rasagiline treatment at any dose has not been sufficiently characterized to avoid restriction of dietary tyramine and amines contained in medications. Mechanism of action: The precise mechanisms of action of rasagiline are unknown. One mechanism is believed to be related to its MAO-B inhibitory activity, which causes an increase in extracellular levels of dopamine in the striatum. The elevated dopamine level and subsequent increased dopaminergic activity are likely to mediate rasagilines beneficial effects seen in models of dopaminergic motor dysfunction. Drug type: Approved.

Its mesylate (i.e. methanesulfonate) salt is sold under tradenames including Edronax, Norebox, Prolift, Solvex, Davedax or Vestra. Reboxetine has two chiral centers, but it only exists as two enantiomers, (R,R)-(-)- and (S,S)-(+)-reboxetine. Pharmacology: Reboxetine is a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (NaRI), the firstdrug of new antidepressant class. Reboxetine is an a-ariloxybenzyl derivative ofmorpholine. Reboxetine is primarily used to treat depression but has also beenfound useful in the treatment of narcolepsy and panic disorders. Mechanism of action: Reboxetine is a selective inhibitor of noradrenaline reuptake. It inhibitsnoradrenaline reuptake in vitro to a similar extent to the tricyclicantidepressant desmethylimipramine. Reboxetine does not affect dopamine orserotonin reuptake and it has low in vivo and in vitro affinityfor adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, dopaminergic and serotonergicreceptors.

It is given to patients during surgery to relieve pain and as an adjunct to an anaesthetic. Remifentanil is a specific  -opioid receptor agonist. Hence, it causes a reduction in sympathetic nervous system tone, respiratory depression and analgesia. Pharmacology: Remifentanil is an opioid agonist with rapid onset and peak effect and ultra-short duration of action. The opioid activity of remifentanil is antagonized by opioid antagonists such as naloxone. The analgesic effects of remifentanil are rapid in onset and offset. Its effects and side effects are dose dependent and similar to other opioids. Remifentanil in humans has a rapid blood-brain equilibration half-time of 1  1 minutes (mean  SD) and a rapid onset of action. Mechanism of action: Remifentanil is a -opioid agonist with rapid onset and peak effect, and short duration of action. The -opioid activity of remifentanil is antagonized by opioid antagonists such as naloxone. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Analgesics, Opioid. Anesthetics, Intravenous.

It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Remoxipride, a substituted benzamide, is a selective D2 receptor antagonist. It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia. Some antipsychotics block domapinergic receptors as well as cholinergic, noradrenergic and histaminergic receptors. Remoxipride was developed to act specifically on the dopamine D2 receptor. As a consequence, several undesired side effects can occur. Patients often feel they are not taking any antipsychotic drug. It has a potent affinity for the sigma receptor, but it is unclear whether it is a sigma agonist or antagonist. The contribution of this property to its clinical profile is unknown. Blocking the D2 dopamine receptor is known to cause relapse in patients that have achieved remission from depression, and such blocking also counteracts the effectiveness of SSRI medication. Mechanism of action: Remoxipride acts as an antagonist at the D2 dopamine receptor. It is believed that overactivity of dopamine systems in the mesolimbic pathway may contribute to the \"positive symptoms\" of schizophrenia (such as delusions and hallucinations), whereas problems with dopamine function in the mesocortical pathway may be responsible for the \"negative symptoms\", such as avolition, flat emotional response and alogia. Therefore, by decreasing the levels of dopamine in these pathways, it is thought that remoxipride is able to reduce the symptoms of schizophrenia. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Withdrawn.

It lowers blood glucose by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas. It achieves this by closing ATP-dependent potassium channels in the membrane of the beta cells. This depolarizes the beta cells, opening the cells' calcium channels, and the resulting calcium influx induces insulin secretion. Pharmacology: Repaglinide is an oral blood glucose-lowering drug of the meglitinide class used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (also known as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus or NIDDM). Repaglinide lowers blood glucose levels by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas. This action is dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Insulin release is glucose-dependent and diminishes at low glucose concentrations. Mechanism of action: Repaglinide closes ATP-dependent potassium channels in the b-cell membrane by binding at characterizable sites. This potassium channel blockade depolarizes the b-cell, which leads to an opening of calcium channels. The resulting increased calcium influx induces insulin secretion.

Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Mechanism of action: Binds to and inhibits the angiotensin converting enzyme. Rescinnamine competes with angiotensin I for binding at the angiotensin-converting enzyme, blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and a negative-feedback mediator for renin activity, lower concentrations result in a decrease in blood pressure and stimulation of baroreceptor reflex mechanisms, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion.

It was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in April 2007 for the treatment of bacterial skin infections such as impetigo. It is marketed as an ointment under the name brand Altabax. It works by inhibiting the bacterial 50S ribosomal unit by binding to the 23S RNA. This prevents peptide synthesis. Pharmacology: Retapamulin is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor belonging to a class of compounds called pleuromutilins. These compounds act by inhibiting the initiation of protein synthesis at the level of bacterial 50S ribosome. Mechanism of action: Retapamulin is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor belonging to a class of compounds called pleuromutilins. These compounds act by inhibiting the initiation of protein synthesis at the level of bacterial 50S ribosome. This binding site involves ribosomal protein L3 and is in the region of the ribosomal P site and peptidyl transferase center. By virtue of binding to this site, pleuromutilins inhibit peptidyl transfer, block P-site interactions, and prevent the normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits. Drug type: Approved.

Retavase is considered a \"third-generation\" thrombolytic agent, genetically engineered to retain and delete certain portions of human tPA. Retavase is a deletion mutein of human tPA formed by deleting various amino acids present in endogenous human tPA. Retavase contains 355 of the 527 amino acids of native human tPA (amino acids 1-3 and 176-527), and retains the activity-related kringle-2 and serine protease domains of human tPA. Three domains are deleted from retavase - kringle-1, finger, and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Pharmacology: Retavase cleaves the Arg/Val bond in plasminogen to form plasmin. Plasmin in turn degrades the fibrin matrix of the thrombus, thereby exerting its thrombolytic action. This helps eliminate blood clots or arterial blockages that cause myocardial infarction. Mechanism of action: Retavase cleaves the Arg/Val bond in plasminogen to form plasmin. This in turn leads to the degradation of blood clots. Drug type: Approved. Biotech.

The drug inhibits the activity of the enzyme RNA dependent RNA polymerase, due to it's resemblence to building blocks of the RNA molecules. The oral form is used in the treatment of hepatitis C, in combination with interferon drugs. The aerosol form is used to treat respiratory syncytial virus-related diseases in children. The primary serious adverse effect of ribavirin is hemolytic anemia, which may worsen preexisting cardiac disease. Mechanism of action: Ribavirin is readily phosphorylated intracellularly by adenosine kinase to ribavirin mono-, di-, and triphosphate metabolites. Ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) is a potent competitive inhibitor of inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase, viral RNA polymerase and messenger RNA (mRNA) guanylyltransferase (viral). Guanylyltranserase inhibition stops the capping of mRNA. These diverse effects result in a marked reduction of intracellular guanosine triphosphate (GTP) pools and inhibition of viral RNA and protein synthesis.

(PubChem) Pharmacology: Riboflavin or vitamin B2 is an easily absorbed, water-soluble micronutrient with a key role in maintaining human health. Like the other B vitamins, it supports energy production by aiding in the metabolising of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. Vitamin B2 is also required for red blood cell formation and respiration, antibody production, and for regulating human growth and reproduction. It is essential for healthy skin, nails, hair growth and general good health, including regulating thyroid activity. Riboflavin also helps in the prevention or treatment of many types of eye disorders, including some cases of cataracts. Mechanism of action: Binds to riboflavin hydrogenase, riboflavin kinase, and riboflavin synthase. Riboflavin is the precursor of flavin mononucleotide (FMN, riboflavin monophosphate) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The antioxidant activity of riboflavin is principally derived from its role as a precursor of FAD and the role of this cofactor in the production of the antioxidant reduced glutathione. Reduced glutathione is the cofactor of the selenium-containing glutathione peroxidases among other things. The glutathione peroxidases are major antioxidant enzymes.

However, there currently are no clinical indications for preferential use of ridogrel over aspirin. Pharmacology: Ridogrel, a combined thromboxane synthase inhibitor and receptor antagonist, is used with streptokinase as an adjunctive therapy to reduce the formation and size of blood clots. Blood clots can cause ischemic cardiac events (heart attacks). Ridogrel has the dual property of inhibiting the synthesis of thromboxane and blocking the receptors of thromboxane/prostaglandin/endoperoxides. It has been shown to accelerate the speed of recanalization and to delay or prevent reocclusion during systemic thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (streptokinase). Ridogrel is a more potent antiplatelet agent than aspirin and might offer an advantage over aspirin as an adjunct to thrombolysis in patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction. While aspirin inhibits cyclooxygenase, the enzyme responsible for producing thromboxane, ridogrel inhibits thromboxane synthesis directly. A recent comparison between aspirin and ridogrel in as adjunct to thrombolysis in patients with acute myocardial infarction demonstrated that ridogrel is not superior to aspirin in enhancing the fibrinolytic efficacy of streptokinase but might be more effective in preventing new ischemic events. Clinical experience with this drug is still relatively limited. Mechanism of action: Ridogrel inhibits thromboxane A2 synthase and also blocks the thromboxane A2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptors.Thromboxane synthetase produces thromboxane in platelets. Thromboxane is a vasoconstrictor and facilitates the clumping of platelets. Therefore by inhibiting the production and promotion of thromboxane, thrombolysis is reduced. Drug type: Approved.

Mechanism of action: The action of risedronate on bone tissue is based partly on its affinity for hydroxyapatite, which is part of the mineral matrix of bone. Risedronate also targets farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (such as pamidronate, alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate and zoledronate) appear to act as analogues of isoprenoid diphosphate lipids, thereby inhibiting FPP synthase, an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Inhibition of this enzyme in osteoclasts prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids (FPP and GGPP) that are essential for the post-translational farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of small GTPase signalling proteins. This activity inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone mass. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule.

It has been shown to improve both positive and negative symptoms in the treatment of schizophrenia. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic medication. It is most often used to treat delusional psychosis (including schizophrenia), but risperidone is also used to treat some forms of bipolar disorder and psychotic depression. It also has shown some success in treating symptoms of Asperger's Syndrome and autism. Risperidone is now the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic medication in the United States. Mechanism of action: Blockade of dopaminergic D2 receptors in the limbic system alleviates positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations, delusions, and erratic behavior and speech. Blockade of serotonergic 5-HT2 receptors in the mesocortical tract, causes an excess of dopamine and an increase in dopamine transmission, resulting in an increase in dopamine transmission and an elimination of core negative symptoms. Dopamine receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway are not affected by risperidone and extrapyramidal effects are avoided. Like other 5-HT2 antagonists, risperidone also binds at alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors and, to a lesser extent, at histamine H1 and alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors. Drug type: Approved. Investigational.

(Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Ropinirole is a nonergot dopamine agonist with high relative in vitro specificity and full intrinsic activity at the D2 subfamily of dopamine receptors, binding with higher affinity to D3 than to D2 or D4 receptor subtypes. The relevance of D3 receptor binding in Parkinson's disease is unknown. The mechanism of ropinirole-induced postural hypotension is presumed to be due to a D2 -mediated blunting of the noradrenergic response to standing and subsequent decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. Mechanism of action: Ropinirole binds the dopamine receptors D3 and D2. Although the precise mechanism of action of ropinirole as a treatment for Parkinson's disease is unknown, it is believed to be related to its ability to stimulate these receptors in the striatum. This conclusion is supported by electrophysiologic studies in animals that have demonstrated that ropinirole influences striatal neuronal firing rates via activation of dopamine receptors in the striatum and the substantia nigra, the site of neurons that send projections to the striatum.

It is marketed by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline as a stand-alone drug (Avandia) and in combination with metformin (Avandamet) or with glimepiride (Avandaryl).Like other thiazolidinediones, the mechanism of action of rosiglitazone is by activation of the intracellular receptor class of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), specifically PPAR. Rosiglitazone is a selective ligand of PPAR, and has no PPAR-binding action.Apart from its effect on insulin resistance, it appears to have an anti-inflammatory effect: nuclear factor kappa-B (NFB) levels fall and inhibitor (IB) levels increase in patients on rosiglitazone.Recent research has suggested that rosiglitazone may also be of benefit to a subset of patients with Alzheimer's disease not expressing the ApoE4 allele. This is the subject of a clinical trial currently underway. Pharmacology: Rosiglitazone, a member of the drug group known as the thiazolidinediones or \"insulin sensitizers\", is not chemically or functionally related to the alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, the biguanides, or the sulfonylureas. Rosiglitazone targets insulin resistance and, hence, is used alone or with metformine or sulfonylurea to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Mechanism of action: Rosiglitazone acts as an agonist at peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR) in target tissues for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPAR-gamma receptors regulates the transcription of insulin-responsive genes involved in the control of glucose production, transport, and utilization. In this way, rosiglitazone enhances tissue sensitivity to insulin. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Fibrinolytic Agents. Hypoglycemic Agents. Thazolidinediones.

It is used to treat primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson types IIa and IIb). Mechanism of action: Rosuvastatin selectively and competitively inhibits the hepatic enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. As HMG-CoA reductase is responsible for converting HMG-CoA to mevalonate, this results in a decrease in mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol, and a subsequent decrease in hepatic cholesterol levels and increase in uptake of LDL cholesterol.

Roxithromycin has similar antimicrobial spectrum as erythromycin, but is more effective against certain gram-negative bacteria, particularly Legionella pneumophila. It can treat respiratory tract, urinary and soft tissue infections. Pharmacology: Roxithromycin is a semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotic. It is very similar in composition, chemical structure and mechanism of action to erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin. Roxithromycin has the following antibacterial spectrum in vitro: Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcus), Neisseria meningitides (Meningococcus), Listeria monocytogenes, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Legionella pneumophila, Helicobacter (Campylobacter), Gardnerella vaginalis, Bordetella pertussis, Moraxella catarrhalis (Branhamella Catarrhalis), and Haemophilus ducreyi. Roxithromycin is highly concentrated in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages, achieving intracellular concentrations greater than those outside the cell. Roxithromycin enhances the adhesive and chemotactic functions of these cells which in the presence of infection produce phagocytosis and bacterial lysis. Roxithromycin also possesses intracellular bactericidal activity. Mechanism of action: Roxithromycin prevents bacteria from growing, by interfering with their protein synthesis. Roxithromycin binds to the subunit 50S of the bacterial ribosome, and thus inhibits the translocation of peptides.

It also helps in the maintenance of the action of several hormones and neurotransmitters that affect mood. Highest concentration are found in the brain and the liver. Mechanism of action: S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe) is a natural substance present in the cells of the body. It is a direct metabolite of the essential amino acid L-methionine. SAMe plays a crucial biochemical role in the body by donating a one-carbon methyl group in a process called transmethylation. SAMe, formed from the reaction of L-methionine and adenosine triphosphate catalyzed by the enzyme S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, is the methyl-group donor in the biosynthesis of both DNA and RNA nucleic acids, phospholipids, proteins, epinephrine, melatonin, creatine and other molecules.

It is a short-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist with its main clinical use in asthma. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Salbutamol (INN) or albuterol (USAN), a moderately selective beta(2)-receptor agonist similar in structure to terbutaline, is widely used as a bronchodilator to manage asthma and other chronic obstructive airway diseases. The R-isomer, levalbuterol, is responsible for bronchodilation while the S-isomer increases bronchial reactivity.  The R-enantiomer is sold in its pure form as Levalbuterol.  The manufacturer of levalbuterol, Sepracor, has implied (although not directly claimed) that the presence of only the R-enantiomer produces fewer side-effects. Mechanism of action: Salbutamol is a beta(2)-adrenergic agonist and thus it stimulates beta(2)-adrenergic receptors. Binding of albuterol to beta(2)-receptors in the lungs results in relaxation of bronchial smooth muscles. It is believed that salbutamol increases cAMP production by activating adenylate cyclase, and the actions of salbutamol are mediated by cAMP. Increased intracellular cyclic AMP increases the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, which inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers intracellular calcium concentrations. A lowered intracellular calcium concentration leads to a smooth muscle relaxation. Increased intracellular cyclic AMP concentrations also cause an inhibition of the release of mediators from mast cells in the airways. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule.

It has bacteriostatic, fungicidal, and keratolytic actions. Its salts, the salicylates, are used as analgesics. Pharmacology: Salicylic acid treats acne by causing skin cells to slough off more readily, preventing pores from clogging up. This effect on skin cells also makes salicylic acid an active ingredient in several shampoos meant to treat dandruff. Use of straight salicylic solution may cause hyperpigmentation on unpretreated skin for those with darker skin types (Fitzpatrick phototypes IV, V, VI), as well as with the lack of use of a broad spectrum sunblock. Subsalicylate in combination with bismuth form the popular stomach relief aid known commonly as Pepto-Bismol. When combined the two key ingredients help control diarrhea, nausea, heartburn, and even gas. It is also very mildly anti-biotic. Mechanism of action: Salicylic acid directly and irreversibly inhibits the activity of both types of cyclo-oxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2) to decrease the formation of precursors of prostaglandins and thromboxanes from arachidonic acid.  Salicylate may competitively inhibit prostaglandin formation. Salicylate's antirheumatic (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory) actions are a result of its analgesic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Salicylic acid is a key ingredient in many skin-care products for the treatment of acne, psoriasis, calluses, corns, keratosis pilaris, and warts. It works by causing the cells of the epidermis to slough off more readily, preventing pores from clogging up, and allowing room for new cell growth. Because of its effect on skin cells, salicylic acid is used in several shampoos used to treat dandruff. Salicylic acid is also used as an active ingredient in gels which remove verrucas (plantar warts). Salicylic acid inhibits the oxidation of uridine-5-diphosphoglucose (UDPG) competitively with nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD) and noncompetitively with UDPG. It also competitively inhibits the transferring of glucuronyl group of uridine-5-phosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA) to the phenolic acceptor. The wound-healing retardation action of salicylates is probably due mainly to its inhibitory action on mucopolysaccharide synthesis. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule.

Pharmacology: Salmeterol is a long acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonist (LABA), usually only prescribed for severe persistent asthma following previous treatment with a short-acting beta agonist such as salbutamol and is prescribed concurrently with a corticosteroid, such as beclometasone. The primary noticable difference of salmeterol to salbutamol is that the duration of action lasts approximately 12 hours in comparison with 4-6 hours of salbutamol. When used regularly every day as presecribed, inhaled salmeterol decreases the number and severity of asthma attacks. However, it is not for use for relieving an asthma attack that has already started. Inhaled salmeterol works like other beta 2-agonists, causing bronchodilatation by relaxing the smooth muscle in the airway so as to treat the exacerbation of asthma. Salmeterol is similar in action to formoterol, however formoterol has been demonstrated to have a faster onset of action than salmeterol as a result of a lower lipophilicity, and has also been demonstrated to be more potent - a 12 g dose of formoterol has been demonstrated to be equivalent to a 50 g dose of salmeterol. Mechanism of action: Salmeterol's long, lipophilic side chain binds to exosites near beta(2)-receptors in the lungs and on bronchiolar smooth muscle, allowing the active portion of the molecule to remain at the receptor site, continually binding and releasing. Beta(2)-receptor stimulation in the lung causes relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, bronchodilation, and increased bronchial airflow. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule.

Salsalate is readily soluble in the small intestine where it is partially hydrolyzed to two molecules of salicylic acid. A significant portion of the parent compound is absorbed unchanged and undergoes rapid esterase hydrolysis in the body. The parent compound has an elimination half-life of about 1 hour. Salicylic acid (the active metabolite) biotransformation is saturated at anti-inflammatory doses of salsalate. Such capacity limited biotransformation results in an increase in the half-life of salicylic acid from 3.5 to 16 or more hours.

It is a highly specific inhibitor of HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Saquinavir is a protease inhibitor with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Protease inhibitors block the part of HIV called protease. HIV-1 protease is an enzyme required for the proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors into the individual functional proteins found in infectious HIV-1. Saquinavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. Protease inhibitors are almost always used in combination with at least two other anti-HIV drugs. Mechanism of action: Saquinavir inhibits the HIV viral proteinase enzyme which prevents cleavage of the gag-pol polyprotein, resulting in noninfectious, immature viral particles. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-HIV Agents.

Scopolamine and its quaternary derivatives act as antimuscarinics like atropine, but may have more central nervous system effects. Among the many uses are as an anesthetic premedication, in urinary incontinence, in motion sickness, as an antispasmodic, and as a mydriatic and cycloplegic. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Scopolamine is a muscarinic antagonist structurally similar to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and acts by blocking the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and is thus classified as an anticholinergic. Scopolamine has many uses including the prevention of motion sickness. It is not clear how Scopolamine prevents nausea and vomiting due to motion sickness. The vestibular part of the ear is very important for balance. When a person becomes disoriented due to motion, the vestibule sends a signal through nerves to the vomiting center in the brain, and vomiting occurs. Acetylcholine is a chemical that nerves use to transmit messages to each other. It is believe that Scopolamine prevents communication between the nerves of the vestibule and the vomiting center in the brain by blocking the action of acetylcholine. Scopolamine also may work directly on the vomiting center. Scopolamine must be taken before the onset of motion sickness to be effective. Mechanism of action: Scopolamine acts by interfering with the transmission of nerve impulses by acetylcholine in the parasympathetic nervous system (specifically the vomiting center).

Pharmacology: Secobarbital, a barbiturate, is used for the induction of anesthesia prior to the use of other general anesthetic agents and for induction of anesthesia for short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures associated with minimal painful stimuli. Little analgesia is conferred by barbiturates; their use in the presence of pain may result in excitation. Mechanism of action: Secobarbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open.

It is prepared using solid phase peptide synthesis.  Secretin is a peptide hormone produced in the S cells of the duodenum. Its main effect is to regulate the pH of the small  intestines contents through the control of gastric acid secretion and buffering with bicarbonate. It was the first hormone to be discovered. Pharmacology: Used in the diagnosis of pancreatic dysfunction or gastrinoma (stomach cancer), secretin is a hormone produced in the S cells of the duodenum in response to low local pH. It stimulates the secretion of bicarbonate from bicarbonate producing organs(liver, pancreas, Brunner's glands) when the pH drops below a set value. This helps neutralize the gastric acid entering the duodenum from the stomach. It also inhibits acid secretion from the stomach by reducing gastrin release from the G cells of the stomach. Mechanism of action: Secretin binds to the secretin receptor found on the lining of S cells in the duodenum and G cells in the stomach. Binding leads to the secrection of bicarbonate or the reduction of the secretion of gastrin. Properly functioning organs (duodenum, pancreas and stomach) should be responsive to this hormone Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Investigational.

It is used in newly diagnosed patients with Parkinson's disease. It may slow progression of the clinical disease and delay the requirement for levodopa therapy. It also may be given with levodopa upon onset of disability. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p385) The compound without isomeric designation is Deprenyl. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Dopamine is an essential chemical that occurs in many parts of the body. It is the premature degradation of dopamine that results in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is an enzyme which accelerates the breakdown of dopamine. Selegiline can prolong the effects of dopamine in the brain by preventing its breakdown through seletively blocking MAO. It also may prevent the removal of dopamine between nerve endings and enhance release of dopamine from nerve cells. Mechanism of action: Although the mechanisms for selegiline's beneficial action in the treatment of Parkinson's disease are not fully understood, the inhibition of monoamine oxidase type B (MAO B) is thought to be of primary importance. MAO B is involved in the oxidative deamination of dopamine in the brain. Selegiline is best known as an irreversible inhibitor of MAO. MAO's activity is inhibited when selegiline binds to the isoalloxazine flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) at its active center. In addition, there is evidence that selegiline may increase dopaminergic activity through other mechanisms. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antidyskinetics.

Selenium Sulfide is the active ingredient often used in shampoos for the treatment of dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis and tinea capitis, a fungal infection that is primarily a disease of preadolescent children. Pharmacology: Selenium sulfide is an antifungal agent often used in shampoos for the treatment of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. Selenium sulfide is highly active in inhibiting the growth of P. ovale. It is also a proven cytostatic agent, slowing the growth of both hyperproliferative and normal cells in dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. A 0.6% micronized form of selenium sulfide is also safe and effective for dandruff. Mechanism of action: Topical selenium sulfide may act by an antimitotic action, resulting in a reduction in the turnover of epidermal cells. It also has local irritant, antibacterial, and mild antifungal activity, which may contribute to its effectiveness. An antimitotic mechanism of action is suggested by data showing that selenium sulfide decreases the rate of incorporation of radioactively labeled thymidine into the DNA of dermal epithelial cells. The following organisms are generally considered susceptible to selenium sulfide in vitro: Malassezia furfur, Microsporum sp. including Microsporum audouinii and Microsporum canis, Pityrosporon sp., Trichophyton sp. including Trichophyton schoenleinii and Trichophyton tonsurans. Selenium sulfide has been shown to be sporicidal to T. tonsurans, the most common etiologic agent of tinea capitis. One in-vitro study demonstrated that 2.5% selenium sulfide was equivalent in sporicidal activity to both 1% and 2% zinc pyrithione. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule.
