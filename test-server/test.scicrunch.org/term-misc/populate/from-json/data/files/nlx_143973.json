Perikarya were found throughout layer II. Most of their dendrites traveled rostrocaudally. Their dendritic arbors were shaped like cylinders with their long axes parallel to the long axis of the spinal cord. Islet cell axons arborized in the immediate vicinity of their dendritic territories, within layer II.Islet cells had one or more dendrites that demonstrated a characteristic branching pattern in which the dendrite bifurcated with one daughter branch continuing in the same direction as its parent while the other daughter branch curved back towards the perikarya.Islet cells in deep lamina II (lamina IIb) did not respond to noxious stiumuli whereas those in lamina IIa (outer lamina II) specifically responded to noxious stimuli.","DefinitionPMID":"6162863"}}
