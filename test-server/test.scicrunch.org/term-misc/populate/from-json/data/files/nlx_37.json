Sometimes they are arranded in small beaded chains.  They stain bright red with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, deep blue with phospotungstic acid hematoxylin and blue with Luxol fast blue. They express cystatin C and consist of electron-dense amorphous material that contains tubules or vesicular structures.  The amorphous material frequently includes a cytoplasmis island containing neurofilaments and other micro-organelles."}}
