It has been used to treat insomnia, but has been largely superseded and is only offered where an intolerance or allergy to other drugs exists. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Ethchlorvynol is a sedative drug and schedule IV (USA) controlled substance. It produces cerebral depression, however the exact mechanism of action is not known. Mechanism of action: Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, ethchlorvynol appears to depress the central nervous system in a manner similar to that of barbiturates. Barbiturates bind at a distinct binding sites associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged. Drug type: Approved. Illicit. Small Molecule. Drug category: Hypnotics and Sedatives"}}
