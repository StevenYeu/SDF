It should be used cautiously; levallorphan reverses severe opioid-induced respiratory depression but may exacerbate respiratory depression such as that induced by alcohol or other non-opioid central depressants. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p683) Pharmacology: Levallorphan, an opioid antagonist similar to naloxone, is used to treat drug overdoses. Levallorphan differs from naloxone in that it also possesses some agonist properties. It is an analogue of levelorphanol that counteracts the actions of narcotic analgesics such as morphine. It is used especially in the treatment of respiratory depression due to narcotic overdoses. Levallorphan prevents or reverses the effects of opioids including respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. Also, it can reverse the psychotomimetic and dysphoric effects of agonist-antagonists such as pentazocine. Mechanism of action: Levallorphan antagonizes opioid effects by competing for the same receptor sites. It binds to the opioid mu receptor and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha2\/alpha3. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Analgesic Antagonists. Antinarcotic Agents. Morphine Antidotes. Narcotic Antagonists"}}
