Most T3 is derived from peripheral monodeiodination of T4 at the 5' position of the outer ring of the iodothyronine nucleus. The hormone finally delivered and used by the tissues is mainly T3. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Thyroid hormone drugs are natural or synthetic preparations containing tetraiodothyronine (T4, levothyroxine) or triiodothyronine (T3, liothyronine) or both. T4 and T3 are produced in the human thyroid gland by the iodination and coupling of the amino acid tyrosine. Liothyronine (T3) contains three atoms of iodine and is formed by the coupling of one molecule of diiodotyrosine (DIT) with one molecule of monoiodotyrosine (MIT). These hormones enhance oxygen consumption by most tissues of the body and increase the basal metabolic rate and the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. Thus, they exert a profound influence on every organ system in the body and are of particular importance in the development of the central nervous system. Mechanism of action: The thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (liothyronine or T3), are tyrosine-based hormones produced by the thyroid gland. An important component in the synthesis is iodine. The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T4). This is converted to the active liothyronine within cells by deiodinases. liothyronine acts on the body to increase the basal metabolic rate, affect protein synthesis and increase the body's sensitivity to catecholamines (such as adrenaline). The thyroid hormones are essential to proper development and differentiation of all cells of the human body. To various extents they regulate protein, fat and carbohydrate metabolism. But they have their most pronounced effects on how human cells use energetic compounds. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Hormone Replacement Agents"}}
