Following intravenous injection, radioiodinated albumin human is uniformly distributed throughout the intravascular pool within 10 minutes; extravascular distribution takes place more slowly (2 days). Indicated for use in determinations of total blood and plasma volumes, cardiac output, cardiac and pulmonary blood volumes and circulation times Pharmacology: Regulates the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood. It is used to increase the circulating plasma volume, thereby reducing hemoconcentrtion and blood viscosity. Also used as a transport protein that binds naturally occurring, therapeutic and toxic materials in circulation. Mechanism of action: Serum albumin acts as a high molecular weight, very soluble osmolyte Drug type: Approved. Biotech. Drug category: Imaging Agents"}}
