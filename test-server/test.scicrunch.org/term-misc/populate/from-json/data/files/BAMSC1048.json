These cells are easy to distinguish by the very dense nature of their small dendritic trees. This high density is due to frequent, irregular branching of fine dendrites, which curve, twist, and overlap extensively (Fig. 2D). Their cell body is generaly located well within the confines of the dendritic tree. RGB2 cells were found across the retina (Fig. 9). RGB2 cells had a very small but very dense dendritic field (Fig. 5B), featuring numerous tiny branches bearing spines. They ramified almost in the middle of the IPL."}}
